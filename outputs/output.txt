Add Your Photo Photos of Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup 01 of 167 Photo by Dotdash Meredith Food Studios 02 of 167 Photo by Allrecipes Member 03/12/2025 While this is a good base recipe, I recommend browning the onions in some of the sausage fat along with adding the spices to the onion to bloom them and develop those flavors. Personally, I think this is too much dairy, so I opt in for adding three cups of chicken stock, and having the option of adding half and half per serving.The recipe doesn’t call for salt but I also recommend adding salt as you go and at the end. Feel free to double up on the spices and add mince garlic and garlic powder as well to develop a more complex flavor. Without salt, it would have been bland to be honest.I do love this recipe overall though because it allows you to just build on it to your liking! 03 of 167 Photo by LimeBean8582 12/06/2024 A keeper! Great flavors I decided to brown the onions with the sausage, which brought out more flavors. I also added fresh rosemary. Delicious! 04 of 167 Photo by dells1978 12/27/2023 It was so good. Thank you for sharing. I used ground turkey. Also, I used half the whip. 05 of 167 Photo by My Hot Southern Mess 09/25/2023 I made this as written, ingredient wise. Cooking method, I used my instant pot. As written, like many others have said, it is on the bland side. It was also not as creamy as we would have liked. With tweaks it has potential, as is it wasn't for us. 06 of 167 Photo by FlimsyBacon4136 12/05/2022 I loved this recipe. The only thing different I did was use pork sausage instead of Italian red potatoes, plus I had to improvise by using garlic powder, and onion powder. I didn't know I was out. I think it would be excellent if I had actually used onion and minced garlic, but it was still delicious. I also, used whipping cream instead of half an half. I suggest this recipe to anyone who wants great tasting easy to make soup. Easy on the wallet also!! Thank you for sharing it with us!! 07 of 167 Photo by Baron L Howell 04/05/2022 I made it with some slight alterations ... I added more kill more potatoes and more seasoning ...It came out delicious ... I will make it again with a few adjustments ... 08 of 167 Photo by mcooks 04/21/2021 09 of 167 Photo by franklinl831 04/21/2021 10 of 167 Photo by franklinl831 04/21/2021 1 2 3 4 5 Next You’ll Also Love Spicy and Creamy Vegetable Soup 17 Ratings Red Winter Minestrone with Winter Greens Pesto Hungarian Potato and Sausage Soup 90 Ratings Caldo Verde (Portuguese Sausage Kale Soup) 65 Ratings Curried Potato and Spinach Soup 3 Ratings Almost Tuscan Sausage and Kale Soup 107 Ratings Kartoffelsuppe nach Bayrischer Art (Bavarian Potato Soup) 8 Ratings Lentil, Kale, and Sausage Soup 4 Ratings Portuguese Sausage and Kale Soup (Caldo Verde) 4 Ratings Keto Caldo Verde with Chorizo 3 Ratings Potato, Spinach, and Leek Soup 4 Ratings Cabbage and Corned Beef Chowder 31 Ratings Italian Vegetable Soup with Beans, Spinach & Pesto 75 Ratings Minestrone Vegetable Soup 17 Ratings O'Cheeze Potato Soup 5 Ratings Mama Kathy's Minestrone 25 Ratings Newsletter Sign Up Newsletter Sign Up By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of reviews for: Duplication: Editors verify that the recipe doesn't duplicate another that has already been published. Completion: The ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use. Accuracy: Serving sizes and yields are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations. Replication: Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals. Health claims: Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims — such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo — based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand, Eating Well . Once recipes are evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools.

In the reviews, they share tips for making recipes even better and adjusting them to personal tastes or diets.

For recipes that have a long trail of user commentary, editors and testers also evaluate and incorporate suggestions from the community.

Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition , too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread , without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less. Our History Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month. Every day, cooks from around the world publish recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The combination of the Allrecipes community with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels. You can connect with us and our 11M followers on social media, too. On TikTok , learn how you should store avocados or find out if air fryer coconut shrimp lives up to the hype. On Facebook and Pinterest you can browse easy weeknight meals and scour reviews of the world's best air fryers. Find photo-worthy dinner inspiration on Instagram . And on YouTube, cook along with Chef John, who serves up creative, new recipes weekly — alongside a few good laughs thanks to his well-timed puns. If you own an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant device, you'll find our recipes easily discoverable via Voice search. Above all, we are: Friendly We love trading ideas and hanging out with fellow home cooks. Supportive Struggling with dinner inspo? We’re here to help! Creative Cooking is an art. We like to experiment and express ourselves. Approachable We don't judge—all cooking levels and recipes are welcome. Down-to-Earth We love good food, period. It doesn’t need to be fussy to be great. Fun Like you, we enjoy friends, family, cooking, and having a good laugh. Allrecipes Magazine The food industry's first large-scale digital-to-print brand extension, Allrecipes magazine launched in 2013. Now published six times a year, it reaches an audience of nearly 9 million. The magazine serves up a seasonal slice of recipes and real-cook wisdom from Allrecipes.com — along with the best of what's new from the greater food and cooking community (emerging trends, entertaining ideas, new products, and more). We aim for a mix of approachable inspiration and down-to-earth service in every issue. A majority of the recipes in Allrecipes magazine start with creations shared by home cooks on Allrecipes.com. All are tested, tasted, refined, edited, and professionally photographed before they appear in the magazine. Our editors and contributors also research and write about entertaining, diverse cuisines, Allrecipes Allstars and other fascinating cooks, kitchen decor and organization, cooking gadgets and gear, culinary travel, health, special diets, nutrition, parenting, and pets. We incorporate the best advice from editors, testers, and the cooking community to make good recipes better, great recipes easier, and every day a little more delicious. Sign up for a subscription now . The Allrecipes Community The heart of Allrecipes is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later. Community Guidelines We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you remember that a fellow Allrecipes community member has shared their recipe with you. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved. The Allrecipes Allstars Social media influencers, registered dietitians, grillmasters, and more seasoned home cooks make up our enthusiastic squad of 100+ brand ambassadors. This diverse, food-loving crew spans the U.S. geographically and represents many different cultures, ethnicities, and family makeups. Since 2011, the Allrecipes Allstars have created tens of thousands of original recipes, photos, and reviews plus shared their cooking expertise via flat and video content on our website, social media, plus more marketing channels. Sound like fun? Apply to join the Allrecipes Allstar team . We're always recruiting. Recipe Approval and Testing Kitchen-Approved Recipes When Allrecipes’ readers add a recipe to the site, they may choose to save it as private, only share it on their profile page, or submit it for Kitchen Approved consideration. Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of reviews for: Duplication: Editors verify that the recipe doesn't duplicate another that has already been published. Completion: The ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use. Accuracy: Serving sizes and yields are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations. Replication: Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals. Health claims: Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims — such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo — based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand, Eating Well . Once recipes are evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted. After publication, the Allrecipes audience can add their own photos, ratings, and reviews to recipes. In the reviews, they share tips for making recipes even better and adjusting them to personal tastes or diets. Allrecipes Magazine Recipe Testing Recipes selected for publication in Allrecipes magazine get further scrutiny and testing.. Magazine recipes are tested one to four times in our test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama. Trained test kitchen professionals prepare every recipe and then taste and evaluate it with recipe and story editors, confirming and clarifying all key components (including ingredient types and amounts, cooking procedures and times and temperatures, yields), and incorporating changes as needed to improve flavor, ease, and visual appeal. For recipes that have a long trail of user commentary, editors and testers also evaluate and incorporate suggestions from the community. Fully tested and edited recipes are then prepared by a food stylist for professional photography and reviewed again by a registered dietitian for nutrition and health-related tags used in the magazine (Healthy Pick, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free). Product Reviews Our product reviews are independent and based on research and product testing — if you visit links within our content, we may receive commissions from your purchases, but we never receive any compensation or consideration for the content of our recommendations. Learn more about our review process . Editorial Guidelines At Allrecipes, we take great pride in the quality of our content. Our writers, photographers, and editors create original, accurate, and engaging content that reflects the interests and concerns of home cooks, and our recipe editors verify all user submissions before publication. Original illustrations, graphics, images, and videos are created by internal teams who collaborate with experts in their fields to produce assets that represent diverse voices, perspectives, and contexts. Photos and videos are not edited in any way that may cause them to be false or misleading. We correct any factual errors in a transparent manner and strive to make it easy for our readers to bring errors to our attention. Read our full integrity promise including our policies on accuracy and corrections, fact checking independence and impartiality, and originality here . At Allrecipes, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT. Our Values Allrecipes believes everyone and every voice deserves a seat at the table. We want all home cooks to find dishes that represent them and honor their heritage, and we strive to cultivate a community reflective of our readers’ varied backgrounds. That goes for our team, too! We are diligent about working with writers, editors, photographers, and recipe developers with expertise in all types of cuisines . Our goal is to make room for everyone at the table (so long as they share the secrets to grandma’s best recipes).

It did take a little longer than 10 minutes for my macaroni noodles to be done. Next time, I might try fresh spinach instead of canned. Still, it is very good exactly as is! In the refrigerator, the macaroni soaked up most of the juice, causing a goulash-like consistency!

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings ¼ pound bacon 1 ½ pounds red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 quart half-and-half 1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), cubed ½ teaspoon ground white pepper ½ teaspoon garlic powder ½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided ¼ cup chopped fresh chives, divided ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, divided Directions Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and crumble when cool. Cover potatoes with water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat until tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes; drain. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat and stir in flour; mix until smooth. Reduce heat to medium-low and slowly whisk in half-and-half until smooth. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, and cook until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in processed cheese cubes until melted and smooth. Season with white pepper, garlic powder, and hot pepper sauce. Mix in cooked potatoes, cover, and simmer until potatoes are very tender and soup is thickened, about 30 minutes; stir occasionally. Ladle soup into bowls and top each bowl with equal amounts shredded Cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, chives, and parsley. Cook's Note: I have made this using processed cheese loaf and using the processed cheese in the jar. I like the jar better. I have used all shredded cheese. This takes 1 cup plus the extra for topping. I like using real cheese versus the box or jar, but it does not taste the same.

As others have said, it definitely needs some seasoning (basil, oregano) and a good amount of pesto. With some parmesan cheese on top, really good! 07 of 08 Photo by Sharyn 03/13/2010 I was surprised how quickly this soup went together -- I had it on the table in about an hour. I mixed a healthy dose of pesto in with the soup (rather than using as a dollop/topping). I cut the potatoes into large dices so they would hold up to freezing/reheating. I'll definitely make this soup again. 08 of 08 Photo by Violet 05/24/2008 Healthy, tasty, well balanced, and very filling recipe! I made minor modifications based on other reviews and personal preferences, but the recipe would have been great without any changes. I sauteed 5 minced garlic cloves with the onion, I used a vegetable broth since I am a vegetarian, I cooked orzo separately and added some to each bowl, and I put the pesto directly in the pot (6 spoonfuls). My family ate this for dinner for three days in a row and never tired of it.

This soup was so simple using leftovers from our boiled Irish dinner yesterday! Followed recipe (except to add quartered baby potatos and sliced carrots) until the half and half. Only had milk. Then I discovered that someone left an almost empty pack of cream cheese in the fridge (doh!) so I used a can of cream corn. By then, I already liked the thickness of it, so didn't bother with the cornstarch and water. This was a nice change from the regular corned beef and cabbage soup.

Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings 1 ½ pounds Portuguese linguica sausage, cut into 1/2-inch think slices 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium onions, chopped 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 8 cups chicken broth 4 medium white potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 pound kale, stemmed and cut into strips 1 cup cannellini beans, drained salt to taste Directions Saute sausage slices in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings 1 pound bulk Italian sausage 1 bunch kale, chopped into bite-sized pieces 4 medium carrots, diced 1 medium onion, diced 9 cups water 1 ⅓ cups lentils, rinsed 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1 tablespoon brown sugar 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 ¼ teaspoons garam masala (Optional) 1 teaspoon dried thyme ½ teaspoon dried dill weed ½ teaspoon dried tarragon salt to taste Directions Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned, about 5 minutes. Add kale stems, carrots, and onion; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in water and lentils; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, garam masala, thyme, dill, tarragon, and salt into the pot. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Toss in kale leaves and let wilt, about 5 minutes. Cook's Notes: Tastes great with Italian or breakfast sausage, but if you leave it out, it's a nice vegetarian soup. Garam masala is an Indian spice. It can be spicy.

It is more of a main dish than an appetizer. In Germany, the sausage of choice would be Regensburg sausage, a short and stubby parboiled pork sausage. It can be substituted with other boiling sausages made of pork.

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed 1 large onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste 1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste 1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage, removed from casings and crumbled ½ teaspoon chopped fresh basil ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika (Optional) 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth 4 cups chopped kale 1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup peeled and chopped yellow potatoes, or more to taste Directions Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat until the oil shimmers; cook and stir onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper until onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix sausage, basil, and paprika together in a bowl. Stir sausage mixture into onion mixture; cook and stir until sausage is browned and fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, kale, cannellini beans, and potatoes to sausage-onion mixture; lower heat to medium-low. Cover stockpot and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Cook’s Note To speed up cooking time, I usually steam the potatoes while I'm heating the oil and cooking the sausage. That way, I only have to heat the soup for 10 more minutes once I mix in the potatoes with everything else. But if you have the patience, it's worth cooking the potatoes the slow way. Also, I love spices so I usually toss in a bit of cumin to cook with the onion and garlic. Save I Made It 220 home cooks made it!

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until greens are tender, about 45 minutes. Chef John Chef's Notes I recommend trying to find Portuguese linguica, but pretty much any cured, spicy, smoked sausage will work. Andouille would be a great choice, as would a dried chorizo. As usual, feel free to adapt this as you see fit, but I wouldn't change the recommended russet potatoes. Save I Made It 68 home cooks made it!

Add Your Photo Photos of Caldo Verde (Portuguese Sausage Kale Soup) 01 of 12 Photo by Chef John 02 of 12 Photo by alpinefrogy 11/11/2022 I’m Portuguese and grow my own Portuguese kale, it’s very different than the kale you buy at the store. It’s a flat leaf kale and the leaves grow very large. As for the Linguica you really can’t substitute any other sausage as our sausage is very different than Italian or Polish sausage in taste and spices. I would recommend that you Google it and have it shipped to you. It is available in many Portuguese communities from east coast to west coast. I make it every christmas with my cousins. I love making Caldo Verda even tho I was not brought up with this soup because my family is from Madeira Island and this soup is from the Azores. The recipe I have is slightly different as it includes finely chopped garlic and the kale is chopped very thin as well. 03 of 12 Photo by Juanita Dunkley 02/22/2021 I added 4 cloves of garlic. I love garlic. I couldn't find any Portuguese sausage so used chorizo and bacon instead. I like a thicker soup so I did use a 4th Potato. I think I would add a 5th and more kale. Lots of flavour and otherwise a hit 04 of 12 Photo by Sbpetinga 02/07/2021 05 of 12 Photo by Eric Ochieng 08/02/2020 06 of 12 Photo by Marina Cardoso 04/27/2020 My very first time making a Portuguese soup. It came out very good! Followed the recipe with a few minor changes. I didn’t have a scale to measure the potatoes, so I eye balled it. I also added a little garlic with the onion for more flavor and a handful of finely chopped carrots with the kale. It is delicious!! 07 of 12 Photo by saz410 04/15/2020 This came out pretty good. The only things I did different was one quart of chicken stock and one quart of water instead of 2 quarts stock. Then after I mashed the potatoes, I poured them into a blender to purée them which made the base creamier. Then returned to the pan to add chourico and kale. The only kale I had was frozen but it did the job. My Portuguese husband will be happy tonight with his Irish wife’s cooking. 08 of 12 Photo by Arienne 01/02/2020 It's more like "Soggy Mashed Potatoes with Kale" than a soup, both in texture and consistency. Even with only about 3/4Lb Kale and 1/4Lb Spinach it was extremely thick. My husband preferred to not eat on his lunch break when he came home to this. Very disappointing for us as devout Chef John followers. I basically refuse to waste food so to salvage it I've been putting about 3c at a time into a medium Pyrex pan, covering with 1/2c enriched white rice and 1c water, or 1 small packet of Saffron Rice Mix and 1c water. I bake it for like an hour(+) at 350°, stirring occasionally, to turn the already thick nature into a casserole. 09 of 12 Photo by Rebecca Chu 12/06/2019 10 of 12 Photo by Mike Henneberry 10/26/2019 Made mine to specifications except I added a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and a little bit more than a shake-ah shake-ah of cayenne and didn’t do a good job of mashing my potatoes.

There are certain recipes that comfort the body and soul in a profound way and this hearty potato and sausage soup is in that class. I think you'll agree it's one of the best things you've had in a long time. The savory flavor from smoked sausage and the earthy sweetness from onions and cabbage are balanced perfectly with a splash of vinegar and a bit of sour cream, all brought together by soft and tender potatoes--the only way this gets better is serving it with a nice hunk of buttered, crusty bread.

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 ounces smoked Hungarian sausage, sliced into rounds 1 yellow onion, diced 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika 5 cups chicken broth, or more to taste 2 cups chopped green cabbage 1 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cubed freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 bay leaf 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar ½ cup sour cream, or to taste 2 tablespoons sliced green onion, or to taste (Optional) Directions Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add sausage and cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove sausage to a bowl, leaving behind any butter in the pot. Toss onion into the pot with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir until onion just starts to turn translucent and picks up a brown color from the meat juices in the pan, 4 to 5 minutes. Add flour; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and paprika; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute, being careful not to burn the paprika. Stir in 5 cups chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally so flour does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Stir in cabbage and cook until it just loses its stiffness, about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and bring back to a simmer. Add black pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf, plus a splash of chicken broth if desired. Bring back to a simmer. Stir soup and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are very soft and tender, about 30 minutes. Add sausage and vinegar and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt. Remove from heat and ladle into bowls. Garnish with sour cream, green onions, and cayenne pepper. Chef's Notes Olive oil can be used for butter, apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar can be used for white vinegar, and any paprika can be used in place of Hungarian paprika. If you can't find Hungarian sausage, use Polish sausage or any other smoked sausage. Use chives, parsley, or dill to garnish the soup instead of green onions if preferred. Cut your potatoes into any size you want, but the pieces should be uniform and small enough to fit on a soup spoon.

You can always count on Chef John; He's truly the Galileo of sausage and potato! 03 of 20 Photo by Alene Ray 02/14/2021 I doubled the recipe. It was good but we all agreed next time I should double the sausage and cabbage and use 3/4 or 1/2 of the potatoes the recipe calls for. When the potatoes get cut up they go A LONG way. 04 of 20 Photo by Arti 05/21/2020 Hearty, very comforting recipe. My husband has a love for eastern European dishes and this was perfect for him.

Yep, I'm going tip-to-tail. The soup itself gets its lovely red color from beets. You'll have more pesto than you need for the soup, so serve the leftovers over pasta or freeze for future soups. Serve the minestrone with crusty bread and a salad.

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings Winter Greens Pesto: 1 bunch beet greens 1 bunch turnip greens 1 bunch kale ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic 1 ounce Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, grated ½ teaspoon kosher salt Red Winter Minestrone: 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 1 white onion, finely chopped 2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, peeled and grated 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary ½ teaspoon kosher salt 1 bay leaf 1 pinch dried chili flakes 1 leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, cleaned, and cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 carrot, peeled and sliced ½ pound turnips, peeled and cubed ½ pound beets, peeled and cubed 1 cup dry white wine 2 cups cooked cannellini beans ½ cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces 5 cups water ¼ cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley ½ tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste (Optional) Directions Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a bowl of ice water. Strip beet greens, turnip greens, and kale from their coarse stems and wash leaves well. Working in batches, cook each bunch in boiling water until bright green and slightly limp, about 1 minute. Transfer immediately to ice water and repeat with remaining greens. Discard cooking water. Remove greens from ice water and squeeze out as much water as possible. Combine greens, 2/3 cup olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer pesto to a bowl and cover surface with plastic wrap. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in onion, grated tomato, 4 cloves minced garlic, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, bay leaf, and chili flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes; reduce heat to low. Continue cooking and stirring until vegetables are a deep golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over onion mixture. Stir in leek, carrot, turnips, and beets. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Pour white wine over vegetable mixture and scrape browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Mix cannellini beans and green beans into vegetable mixture; pour in 5 cups water. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until green beans are tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. Divide soup among heated bowls and serve with a generous dollop of the winter greens pesto. Tips This recipe was submitted by Herbivoracious in collaboration with the OxBox Project: food bloggers creating delicious recipes featuring Oxbow Farm vegetables. Cook's Notes: I highly recommended cooking the beans yourself, rather than using canned beans. The texture is better and you can use the bean cooking liquid as part of the soup broth for extra flavor. Reserve 3 cups bean cooking liquid and use in place of 3 cups water in step 6. If you're using fresh Roma tomatoes in the soup, dip them in the boiling water for 30 seconds and transfer to ice bath. Remove skins when cool enough to handle. Refrigerate pesto if you're making it ahead of time. The first part of cooking the soup itself is to make a sofrito--onions, tomatoes, and garlic slowly cooked into a flavorful paste. If you have time on your hands, you might want to make a double or triple batch and save the rest to serve on pasta, or eggs, or to flavor rice. Sofrito freezes quite well. If you prefer, you may use 2 canned plum tomatoes, grated, rather than fresh. Editor's Note: Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of pesto ingredients.

Something went wrong. Our team is working on it. This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly. Original recipe (1X) yields 10 servings 1 tablespoon olive oil ½ white onion, chopped ½ cup diced carrot ½ cup diced celery 4 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried rosemary 1 teaspoon dried dill weed 6 cups water 3 tablespoons chicken soup base 1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®) 1 cup peeled and cubed potatoes ½ cup fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped (Optional) 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced ½ cup heavy whipping cream ½ bunch kale, stemmed and chopped Directions Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, and celery until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, rosemary, and dill weed; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour water into onion mixture and bring to a boil. Stir chicken base into the boiling water until dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with green chiles, potatoes, and green beans; bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add browned mushrooms to the soup. Stir heavy cream and kale into soup; cook until kale is tender and soup is heated through, about 5 minutes. Cook's Note: This is easily made vegetarian by using veggie base, cubes, or broth. You can sub water and base for 6 cups chicken broth. I brown the mushrooms to yield a firmer texture and nuttier taste. This freezes well. You may need more water as the soup cooks down. Check for seasonings as you add water, you may want to add more base as well. Save I Made It 22 home cooks made it!

Crowd-pleaser Family favorite This is nearly the same recipe that has been passed down in my family from my grandma but we call it Calico Beans. The only difference was this recipe calls for a half pound more ground beef (but honestly I probably always used a full lb). This recipe is always a winner in our house and my husband loves it. I will note I do drain my kidney and butter beans when I make this, this is especially helpful when you double the recipe. You can easily make this with dried beans, my mom used to when I was growing up and would freeze them also. Lastly, you can sub prepared mustard for dried mustard if needed, you just need a bit more or can adjust to your personal taste. Helpful (0) Roberta Taylor marked My Hot Southern Mess ’s Mexican Chicken Corn Chowder review helpful. 1 week ago My Hot Southern Mess reviewed Kimberly West’s French Cafe Summer Salad . 1 week ago I made this recipe as written, to include the beans and how the potatoes were cooked. If I were to make this again I would dice the potatoes and then cook to allow for more even cooking. Next, this recipe makes way more than 8 servings, I was left searching to find a big enough bowl to mix it up in. The amount of potato and onion, could be cut back. The onion flavor was overpowering. Next the dressing, I did end up doubling it and if I had more mustard, I would have tripled it. As written it is not enough and I didn't really get a ton of extra flavor from it. I will say you need to make sure you whip the olive oil and mustard together until it emulsifies and is not separating. Overall, with some tweaks this could be really good, but as is, it's kind of meh and that is kinda sad with all the work that is put into it.

I was not sure how much onion to use so I used half of a large yellow onion. Baking for 60 minutes was perfect timing (I used a 9x13 glass pan). Unfortunately for different reasons this recipe was not a hit in my house. The amount of onions was one of the big complaints along with the squashy taste. I am a huge fan of zucchini but I wasn't a fan of this recipe, something just wasn't right. My family rated this everywhere from 1-3 so I split my rating in the middle.

Helpful (0) Instant Pot Au Gratin Potatoes 04/21/2025 I made this recipe exactly as written, ingredient and instruction wise (to include using a mandolin and the instant pot instructions) . Overall it is a good recipe but it could use some tweaks. For instance with the potato cook time, my potatoes came out in a mix of slices and mush. I am thinking the 5 minute time was a bit long for release maybe, it is an area that could be tweaked. Flavorwise, while the potatoes were good they were missing something and the seasonings could be tweaked a bit. Additionally in the future I would use some heavy cream or even milk instead of opening a can of evaporated milk that I wasn't going to use all of. I do suggest watching the potatoes carefully in the broiler, this was my biggest mistake of the recipe because I ended up over browning one area of the potatoes... Overall my family gave these potatoes a solid 4 and i'd probably make them again with a few tweaks. Helpful (0) Garlic Teriyaki Edamame 04/14/2025 This was a simple to make edamame recipe. I made it nearly as written, I omitted my sesame oil as it had gone bad and sesame seeds. I simply couldn't find them in my spices cupboard. Even with omitting all of the sesame the recipe is still pretty good. Maybe a little on the sweet side (Which wouldn't be as noticeable with the sesame oil). The longest part was waiting for my sauce to thicken up, as that did take longer than 4-5 minutes.

Cookies Settings Accept All Cookies Memorial Day Deals at Walmart: Pyrex, OXO & More Up to 80% Off Tips for Submitting Your Recipe to Allrecipes Here's how to make your favorite recipe stand out from the crowd. By Allrecipes Editorial Team Updated on July 31, 2023 Close Credit: CHICKIBAM/GETTY IMAGES Take your go-to recipe from favorite to famous! Chances are you're reading this because you enjoy cooking and sharing food with others. Posting one of your own recipes on Allrecipes is a great way to share your creations with a much larger crowd! Whether you improvise your way around the kitchen, tend to tweak ingredients to get the tastiest result, or follow steps methodically, a recipe is the common starting point. At Allrecipes, we get thousands of recipe submissions every year. Here are some top tips to help your recipe stand out from the crowd and get published on the site for everyone to find, try, and review! Tips for Submitting a Recipe to Allrecipes Title Choose a clear title that tells the cook what to expect and includes search-friendly words. " Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta " tells us more about the dish than "Mardi Gras Pasta." Since other cooks often search by ingredient, "Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta" is more likely to pop up. Description Include a short but detailed sentence describing the dish that will get the cook excited and tell them what to expect. Check out AppleChef 's description for Pan-Seared Tilapia for example: "This pan-seared tilapia dish is a delicious and easy way to prepare seafood! Great for a quick weeknight meal accompanied with fresh veggies. Try this healthy dish full of flavor and nutrition!" FUNKYSEAMONKEY 's description for Best Toffee Ever - Super Easy includes an extra tip about which nuts to use: "Chocolate and almonds top off a rich buttery toffee. A simple recipe that you could easily remember and whip up any time. I always get compliments and requests for more. Use any type of nut that you like in place of the almonds. " To help your recipe editor, please stick to basic text and avoid italics, bold type, excess punctuation, and emojis. Ingredients Include measurements For other cooks to get the same result you did, it's helpful for ingredients to be as exact and descriptive as possible. Instead of "cheese, parsley to taste, and garlic," write "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese; ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste; and 1 clove garlic, crushed." List ingredients in order To make a recipe easy to follow, list the ingredients in the order they are used in the recipe. Include ingredient prep If a recipe requires chopped onion, shredded Cheddar cheese, and diced avocado, write that out in the ingredient list (like heathg did in this Breakfast Pita Pizza ) rather than telling the cook to chop, shred, and dice in the steps below. Directions Be descriptive Write out each step and be as thorough and descriptive as possible, using every ingredient that is listed. Instead of "mix everything together" write "Mix flour, milk, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl until batter is smooth." Include temperatures For recipes that use the oven, include a preheating step and give an exact oven temperature, e.g., 350 degrees F. For stovetop recipes, state how hot the burners need to be, e.g., medium heat, medium-high heat. Give pan size and type For baking recipes especially, the wrong size or type of cake pan can seriously affect the outcome of a recipe. Be descriptive and include exact dimensions for any pans used, such as: 9-inch round cake pan, 8-inch square baking dish, 9-inch springform pan, etc. Include doneness tips Let the cook know how to tell if the dish is done by including tips and/or temperature guidelines. For example, when baking a cake instead of "Bake for 30 minutes," this is more helpful: "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes about clean, about 30 minutes." Need a great example to follow? Cindy 's detailed, step-by-step directions for her Italian Lemon Cream Cake have earned the recipe 5 stars with loads of glowing reviews! Time Always add a prep and cook time when submitting your recipe. If your recipe doesn't require cooking, put a zero in the cook time section. Photo Snap a pic of your final dish to show everyone what it should look like and how appetizing it is! Recipe Checklist Here's a handy checklist for all the things you should include in your recipe to set it up for success: Recipe Component Examples Ingredient measurements 1 cup white sugar 8 ounces spaghetti 2 1/2 teaspoons salt Ingredient preparations 1 onion, chopped 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 cup cooked rice Temperature guidelines 325 degrees F medium-high heat Pan sizes and types 9-inch round cake pan 9x13-inch glass baking dish 8-inch square pan Step timings Simmer on low heat for 1 hour. Cook until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned. Cooling and resting Let steak rest 5 minutes before slicing. Cool cake completely before frosting.

Now published six times a year, it reaches an audience of nearly 9 million. The magazine serves up a seasonal slice of recipes and real-cook wisdom from Allrecipes.com — along with the best of what's new from the greater food and cooking community (emerging trends, entertaining ideas, new products, and more). We aim for a mix of approachable inspiration and down-to-earth service in every issue. A majority of the recipes in Allrecipes magazine start with creations shared by home cooks on Allrecipes.com. All are tested, tasted, refined, edited, and professionally photographed before they appear in the magazine. Our editors and contributors also research and write about entertaining, diverse cuisines, Allrecipes Allstars and other fascinating cooks, kitchen decor and organization, cooking gadgets and gear, culinary travel, health, special diets, nutrition, parenting, and pets. We incorporate the best advice from editors, testers, and the cooking community to make good recipes better, great recipes easier, and every day a little more delicious. Sign up for a subscription now . The Allrecipes Community The heart of Allrecipes is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later. Community Guidelines We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you remember that a fellow Allrecipes community member has shared their recipe with you. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved. The Allrecipes Allstars Social media influencers, registered dietitians, grillmasters, and more seasoned home cooks make up our enthusiastic squad of 100+ brand ambassadors. This diverse, food-loving crew spans the U.S. geographically and represents many different cultures, ethnicities, and family makeups. Since 2011, the Allrecipes Allstars have created tens of thousands of original recipes, photos, and reviews plus shared their cooking expertise via flat and video content on our website, social media, plus more marketing channels. Sound like fun? Apply to join the Allrecipes Allstar team . We're always recruiting. Recipe Approval and Testing Kitchen-Approved Recipes When Allrecipes’ readers add a recipe to the site, they may choose to save it as private, only share it on their profile page, or submit it for Kitchen Approved consideration. Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of reviews for: Duplication: Editors verify that the recipe doesn't duplicate another that has already been published. Completion: The ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use. Accuracy: Serving sizes and yields are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations. Replication: Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals. Health claims: Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims — such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo — based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand, Eating Well . Once recipes are evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted. After publication, the Allrecipes audience can add their own photos, ratings, and reviews to recipes. In the reviews, they share tips for making recipes even better and adjusting them to personal tastes or diets. Allrecipes Magazine Recipe Testing Recipes selected for publication in Allrecipes magazine get further scrutiny and testing.. Magazine recipes are tested one to four times in our test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama. Trained test kitchen professionals prepare every recipe and then taste and evaluate it with recipe and story editors, confirming and clarifying all key components (including ingredient types and amounts, cooking procedures and times and temperatures, yields), and incorporating changes as needed to improve flavor, ease, and visual appeal. For recipes that have a long trail of user commentary, editors and testers also evaluate and incorporate suggestions from the community. Fully tested and edited recipes are then prepared by a food stylist for professional photography and reviewed again by a registered dietitian for nutrition and health-related tags used in the magazine (Healthy Pick, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free). Product Reviews Our product reviews are independent and based on research and product testing — if you visit links within our content, we may receive commissions from your purchases, but we never receive any compensation or consideration for the content of our recommendations. Learn more about our review process . Editorial Guidelines At Allrecipes, we take great pride in the quality of our content. Our writers, photographers, and editors create original, accurate, and engaging content that reflects the interests and concerns of home cooks, and our recipe editors verify all user submissions before publication. Original illustrations, graphics, images, and videos are created by internal teams who collaborate with experts in their fields to produce assets that represent diverse voices, perspectives, and contexts. Photos and videos are not edited in any way that may cause them to be false or misleading. We correct any factual errors in a transparent manner and strive to make it easy for our readers to bring errors to our attention. Read our full integrity promise including our policies on accuracy and corrections, fact checking independence and impartiality, and originality here . At Allrecipes, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT. Our Values Allrecipes believes everyone and every voice deserves a seat at the table. We want all home cooks to find dishes that represent them and honor their heritage, and we strive to cultivate a community reflective of our readers’ varied backgrounds. That goes for our team, too! We are diligent about working with writers, editors, photographers, and recipe developers with expertise in all types of cuisines . Our goal is to make room for everyone at the table (so long as they share the secrets to grandma’s best recipes). Meet the Leadership Team Molly Fergus SVP & Associate Group General Manager Molly has been in the digital media lifestyle space since 2010; she joined Dotdash in 2013, where she has managed and launched a broad portfolio of brands, including TripSavvy, Treehugger, and ThoughtCo. Before she joined Dotdash in 2013, Molly was an associate digital editor for Conde Nast Traveler, where she helped launch the magazine's website. She has contributed to a variety of media and nonprofit organizations, including CNN, Women's Wear Daily, Self, and the United Nations Development Programme. Molly has always been passionate about food and eating — so much so that she spent her first year out of college driving the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile around the country. Ashley Kappel Associate General Manager Ashley entered the digital food space in 2007 at launch with MyRecipes.com. In 2014, she moved into operations for Allrecipes, and now manages day-to-day operations on both brands. Before falling in love with food media, she worked at Southern Living in the Travel department where she puttered around the southeast eating at barbecue joints, visiting local festivals, and assisting in creating an exhaustive cabin guide of the Smoky Mountains. Ashley hasn't bought into the air fryer hype but plans to be buried with her beloved stand mixer. Ariel Knutson Senior Editorial Director, Features & Community Before joining Dotdash Meredith in 2021, Arie spent eight years working at Kitchn where she launched and led their news and features program. In addition to editing, Arie has worked as a freelance writer, recipe developer, social media editor, and was once the maître d' at a three-star Michelin restaurant in New York. She’s also a graduate of the culinary techniques program at the International Culinary Center. As an editor, Arie is passionate about the food and cooking stories that center people, place, and culture. She’s currently working on perfecting her cardamom bun recipe, and will never say no to a scoop of ice cream. Diana Moutsopoulos Senior Editorial Director, Evergreen An Allrecipes veteran, Diana joined the team in 2008 to help launch Allrecipes UK and Ireland. After leading Allrecipes.co.uk to the #2 recipe and cooking site in the UK, she joined the Allrecipes.com digital team in 2020. Diana grew up in her parent’s restaurants surrounded by food, but it was only after graduating with a Master’s in political science that she pivoted to a career in food media. She went on to earn a post-graduate degree in gastronomy at the University of Champagne-Ardenne in conjunction with Le Cordon Bleu Paris. There’s no food Diana won’t try at least once — from silk worms in Vietnam to tête de veau in France, she’s tried her fair share of local delicacies. Diana is a Greek cuisine aficionado, running the Instagram account @greek_recipes with more than 15,000 followers and having launched the world’s first International Feta Day in 2020. Victoria Heydt Editorial Operations Director Before joining the Allrecipes team in 2024, Victoria spent six years working for The Spruce Eats where she worked her way from Food Editor to Editorial Director. She has also freelanced as a recipe developer, recipe tester, food photographer, and food writer. Victoria attended The Institute of Culinary Education in New York, where she did a dual externship: testing recipes with chef Sara Moulton and working as a prep cook at Huertas—a Spanish tapas restaurant in the East Village. Devon O’Brien Editorial Director, News As Allrecipes Associate Editorial Director, Devon is focused on all the hottest food trends, new products and ideas and best hacks pertaining to cooking. She has worked as a food editor, writer, and recipe developer and tester for more than a decade at publications including EatingWell, Midwest Living, and The Food Network Magazine.

Add Your Photo Photos of Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup 01 of 167 Photo by Dotdash Meredith Food Studios 02 of 167 Photo by Allrecipes Member 03/12/2025 While this is a good base recipe, I recommend browning the onions in some of the sausage fat along with adding the spices to the onion to bloom them and develop those flavors. Personally, I think this is too much dairy, so I opt in for adding three cups of chicken stock, and having the option of adding half and half per serving.The recipe doesn’t call for salt but I also recommend adding salt as you go and at the end. Feel free to double up on the spices and add mince garlic and garlic powder as well to develop a more complex flavor. Without salt, it would have been bland to be honest.I do love this recipe overall though because it allows you to just build on it to your liking! 03 of 167 Photo by LimeBean8582 12/06/2024 A keeper! Great flavors I decided to brown the onions with the sausage, which brought out more flavors. I also added fresh rosemary. Delicious! 04 of 167 Photo by dells1978 12/27/2023 It was so good. Thank you for sharing. I used ground turkey. Also, I used half the whip. 05 of 167 Photo by My Hot Southern Mess 09/25/2023 I made this as written, ingredient wise. Cooking method, I used my instant pot. As written, like many others have said, it is on the bland side. It was also not as creamy as we would have liked. With tweaks it has potential, as is it wasn't for us. 06 of 167 Photo by FlimsyBacon4136 12/05/2022 I loved this recipe. The only thing different I did was use pork sausage instead of Italian red potatoes, plus I had to improvise by using garlic powder, and onion powder. I didn't know I was out. I think it would be excellent if I had actually used onion and minced garlic, but it was still delicious. I also, used whipping cream instead of half an half. I suggest this recipe to anyone who wants great tasting easy to make soup. Easy on the wallet also!! Thank you for sharing it with us!! 07 of 167 Photo by Baron L Howell 04/05/2022 I made it with some slight alterations ... I added more kill more potatoes and more seasoning ...It came out delicious ... I will make it again with a few adjustments ... 08 of 167 Photo by mcooks 04/21/2021 09 of 167 Photo by franklinl831 04/21/2021 10 of 167 Photo by franklinl831 04/21/2021 1 2 3 4 5 Next You’ll Also Love Spicy and Creamy Vegetable Soup 17 Ratings Red Winter Minestrone with Winter Greens Pesto Hungarian Potato and Sausage Soup 90 Ratings Caldo Verde (Portuguese Sausage Kale Soup) 65 Ratings Curried Potato and Spinach Soup 3 Ratings Almost Tuscan Sausage and Kale Soup 107 Ratings Kartoffelsuppe nach Bayrischer Art (Bavarian Potato Soup) 8 Ratings Lentil, Kale, and Sausage Soup 4 Ratings Portuguese Sausage and Kale Soup (Caldo Verde) 4 Ratings Keto Caldo Verde with Chorizo 3 Ratings Potato, Spinach, and Leek Soup 4 Ratings Cabbage and Corned Beef Chowder 31 Ratings Italian Vegetable Soup with Beans, Spinach & Pesto 75 Ratings Minestrone Vegetable Soup 17 Ratings O'Cheeze Potato Soup 5 Ratings Mama Kathy's Minestrone 25 Ratings Newsletter Sign Up Newsletter Sign Up By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Add Your Photo Photos of Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup 01 of 167 Photo by Dotdash Meredith Food Studios 02 of 167 Photo by Allrecipes Member 03/12/2025 While this is a good base recipe, I recommend browning the onions in some of the sausage fat along with adding the spices to the onion to bloom them and develop those flavors. Personally, I think this is too much dairy, so I opt in for adding three cups of chicken stock, and having the option of adding half and half per serving.The recipe doesn’t call for salt but I also recommend adding salt as you go and at the end. Feel free to double up on the spices and add mince garlic and garlic powder as well to develop a more complex flavor. Without salt, it would have been bland to be honest.I do love this recipe overall though because it allows you to just build on it to your liking! 03 of 167 Photo by LimeBean8582 12/06/2024 A keeper! Great flavors I decided to brown the onions with the sausage, which brought out more flavors. I also added fresh rosemary. Delicious! 04 of 167 Photo by dells1978 12/27/2023 It was so good. Thank you for sharing. I used ground turkey. Also, I used half the whip. 05 of 167 Photo by My Hot Southern Mess 09/25/2023 I made this as written, ingredient wise. Cooking method, I used my instant pot. As written, like many others have said, it is on the bland side. It was also not as creamy as we would have liked. With tweaks it has potential, as is it wasn't for us. 06 of 167 Photo by FlimsyBacon4136 12/05/2022 I loved this recipe. The only thing different I did was use pork sausage instead of Italian red potatoes, plus I had to improvise by using garlic powder, and onion powder. I didn't know I was out. I think it would be excellent if I had actually used onion and minced garlic, but it was still delicious. I also, used whipping cream instead of half an half. I suggest this recipe to anyone who wants great tasting easy to make soup. Easy on the wallet also!! Thank you for sharing it with us!! 07 of 167 Photo by Baron L Howell 04/05/2022 I made it with some slight alterations ... I added more kill more potatoes and more seasoning ...It came out delicious ...

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

When placing the apple mixture into the pie crust, make sure to spoon the apples out of the bowl and discard any excess liquid that is in the bottom of the bowl. The extra liquid can cause the crust to become soggy. The apples will continue to release moisture as the pie bakes. Should I cook apples before making pie? There is no need to cook apples before making the pie. The apples will cook during the baking process. How do I freeze a baked apple pie? Let the baked pie cool completely and then place in the freezer, uncovered. When completely frozen, tightly wrap the pie in a few layers of plastic wrap. You can also use a large freezer bag. A baked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 4 months. When you are ready to serve, let the pie thaw at room temperature for one hour. Reheat the pie in the oven at 375°F on the lowest oven rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. How do I freeze an unbaked apple pie? An unbaked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months. Follow steps 1-7 of the recipe, except DO NOT cut vents in the top of the pie crust. Place the unbaked pie in the freezer, uncovered. After one hour, remove from the freezer, tightly wrap with plastic wrap or use a plastic freezer bag. Freezing the unbaked pie before wrapping will help keep the shape of the dough around the edges. When you're ready to bake, do not thaw. Cut vents in the top of the crust and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F and bake an additional 35-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the juice begins to bubble. What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Other great varieties are: Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Jazz, Golden Delicious, Jonagold or Pink Lady. 4.99 from 805 votes ( 578 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe? Cancel reply 351 Comments Yup I made this. I love honey crisp apples too for preference, but the combo of apples goes a long way. Add some vanilla to the filling and it adds a nice touch. Reply Love this pie. It's my all time favorite.!!! Reply super easy the best and first apple pie I've made with my partner was super funn!!! Reply My family LOVED it … Reply This is absolutely the best Apple Pie ever!! Rather than the Granny Apples, I used Crisp Apples because that’s what I had on hand. I would probably use a little less sugar next time because crisp apples are sweet. This was simple and delicious. Thank You!

Strawberry Icebox Cake Jump to Recipe 541 shares Strawberry icebox cake is a refreshing summer dessert made from scratch in under 30 minutes with layers of juicy strawberries, fluffy whipped cream, and graham crackers. It's perfect for BBQs, potlucks, and Fourth of July parties! Amy's Notes I can’t get enough of fresh strawberries when they’re in season, especially paired with heavy cream! This easy strawberry icebox cake has layers of strawberries, whipped cream, and graham crackers. Make it quick with store-bought graham crackers and whipped cream, or go all out from scratch using our homemade versions! Chill the icebox cake for a few hours and serve the same day, or make it up to 2 days ahead for a stress-free dessert! The recipe fills an 8" x 8" dish but can easily be doubled for a crowd. Enjoy! Ingredients Needed Strawberries : Choose bright red, ripe strawberries for the best berries and cream experience! Whipped Cream : Our whipped cream recipe uses heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cream of tartar. If you don’t have powdered sugar, you can blend regular white sugar until it turns powdery. Cream of tartar helps stabilize the whipped cream, but if you leave it out, the recipe will still work; your whipped cream won't stay as stiff over time. Graham Crackers : Use store-bought graham crackers or make your own with your sourdough starter . We have an easy sourdough graham cracker that you can use with this ice box cake, or to make graham cracker crusts, s'mores, and more! How to Make Strawberry Icebox Cake from Scratch Step 1 Bake the graham crackers. Follow our recipe for sourdough graham crackers if you would like to make them from scratch. If you are using store-bought graham crackers you may skip this step. Step 2 Make the whipped cream. Beat the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Pop the bowl in the fridge to chill until you are ready to assemble the dessert. Step 3 Prepare the strawberries. Wash the strawberries and remove the stems. Cut them into thin even slices. Step 4 Assemble. Place a very thin layer of whipped cream on the bottom of the dish. Layer the ingredients, starting with the graham crackers, whipped cream, and strawberries. Repeat for a second layer. Cover the dish and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, overnight is better. How to Store Make Ahead: You can assemble the dessert up to 2 days ahead of time and keep it covered in the fridge until you are ready to serve it. How to Store: Any leftover strawberry icebox cake can be stored in the fridge, covered, for up to 2 days. How to Freeze: If you'd like to freeze the icebox cake, ensure it is in a freezer-safe container and keep it frozen for up to 30 days. When you're ready to eat it, remove it from the freezer and allow it to thaw until it's easy to slice. Easy Dessert recipes - SUBSCRIBE - Do you like this recipe?

Made this last night after notice of an unexpected guest/dinner this evening. Had 3/4 lb of fresh berries, cream and pantry grahams on hand, so I took a shot at redemption and tossed it together beforehand. This came together in a snap! I was so concerned since the berries are not totally in season yet and still a bit tart. Also not sure how the grahams would soften up (or not?) Used an oval-ish clay dish about 5 .1/2" x 8" . Do not hesitate to make this! It was absolute bliss - kind of like a cheesecake type treat! The whipped cream brought the berries to life, and grahams anchored the whole thing in total yummy bliss. Forget about pretty square portions, lol! I started that way and I think it would be more successful with a true square pan, but my choice of smaller dish to fit the available ingredients made a large spoon necessary. Honestly, when you are serving a homemade treat like this, it just doesn't matter! The deserves a zillion stars, and can easily be made with blueberries, raspberries, etc! Great for a riff, but superior on it's own! Held perfectly for 30 hrs before serving with zero seeping/weeping or whatever. I think this would even go up to the sophisticated notch by rough-breaking the grahams and layering it nice goblet glasses for special guest desserts. A few dark chocolate shaves on top and you are the queen! Reply Can I make it with raspberries? Reply Hi De, we haven't tested this recipe with raspberries but I don't see why not! Sounds delicious 🙂 Reply Very good Reply Thanks Amy. I can’t wait to make this tonight Reply So excited to try! Looks delicious!

Sourdough Lemon Crinkle Cookies Jump to Recipe 340 shares Just like sourdough chocolate crinkle cookies , these sourdough lemon crinkle cookies are soft, chewy, and easy to make with sourdough discard. They’re bursting with tangy lemon flavor and absolutely delicious! Carmyn's notes Say hello to my new seasonal obsession: sourdough lemon crinkle cookies! They're the sunny, zesty twist on our classic chocolate crinkle favorites and honestly, I'm so in love. They're light, lemony, and seriously easy to whip up! For foolproof sourdough lemon crinkle cookies, here are some pro tips to keep in mind: Room Temp Ingredients : Let your egg and sourdough discard come to room temp before mixing. This helps the dough mix up nice and smooth. Go Fresh with Lemon : Freshly squeezed lemon juice makes all the difference! It’s brighter and tastier than the bottled stuff. Chill the Dough : Pop the dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours (or overnight). It’s easier to roll and gives you that classic crinkle look. Sugar Coat Last Minute : Roll the dough in powdered sugar right before baking so it stays on the surface and cracks beautifully. Be Generous : Coat those dough balls well. More sugar means a better crinkle! Happy baking! xx Ingredients & Equipment Needed Dry Ingredients: You'll need all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Wet Ingredients : You'll need sourdough discard , butter , granulated sugar, one egg, vanilla extract, fresh lemon juice and lemon zest. Rolling: You'll need about ¼ cup or more of powdered sugar to roll the cookie dough in to get that classic crinkle cookie look. How to Make Sourdough Lemon Crinkle Cookies Step 1 Whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside. Step 2 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sourdough discard, butter, granulated sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and lemon juice plus their zest. Step 3 Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and mix with a baking spatula. The dough will be thick. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Do not skip chilling the dough. It is mandatory for the next steps. Step 4 Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add the powdered sugar to a plate. Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop and roll the dough into balls using your hands (about 1.5-2 tablespoons of dough or about 30 grams each). Roll each ball very generously in the powdered sugar. Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Step 5 Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes Step 6 Let them cool slightly on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. How to Store How to Store : Baked cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days. To help maintain their freshness and softness, place a small piece of white bread in the container. How to Freeze: Leftover baked cookies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store them in a freezer-safe bag. Unbaked Cookie Dough : Unbaked cookie dough can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze the dough for up to 3 months.

INGREDIENTS Dry Ingredients 2 cups + 2 tablespoons ( 270 g ) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ( 4 g ) baking powder ½ teaspoon ( 3 g ) fine sea salt Wet Ingredients ¼ cup ( 50 g ) sourdough discard 4 tablespoons ( 56 g ) melted butter 1 cup ( 200 g ) granulated sugar 1 egg ½ teaspoon ( 2 g ) vanilla extract 3 tablespoons lemon juice + zest (3 small lemons) Rolling ¼ cup ( 30 g ) powdered sugar (you may need more) INSTRUCTIONS In a bowl, whisk together 2 cups + 2 tablespoons ( 270 g ) all-purpose flour , 1 teaspoon ( 4 g ) baking powder , and ½ teaspoon ( 3 g ) fine sea salt and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together ¼ cup ( 50 g ) sourdough discard , 4 tablespoons ( 56 g ) melted butter , 1 cup ( 200 g ) granulated sugar , 1 egg , ½ teaspoon ( 2 g ) vanilla extract , and 3 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of all the lemons. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and mix with a baking spatula. The dough will be thick. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Do not skip chilling the dough. It is mandatory for the next steps. Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add ¼ cup ( 30 g ) powdered sugar to a plate. Using a cookie scoop, scoop and roll the dough into balls using your hands (about 1.5-2 tablespoons of dough or about 30 grams each). Roll each ball very generously in the powdered sugar. Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. NOTES Use Room Temperature Ingredients: Ensure your egg and sourdough discard are at room temperature before mixing. This helps the dough come together smoothly and creates a more even texture. Use Fresh Lemon Juice: Opt for freshly squeezed lemon juice rather than the bottled kind. Fresh juice provides a brighter, more vibrant flavor while bottled lemon juice will altar the taste. Chill the Dough: Chilling the dough is essential for achieving that classic crinkle effect. Let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to make it easier to handle and roll into balls. Coat Right Before Baking: Roll the cookie dough balls in sugar just before baking. If done too early, the powdered sugar may absorb into the dough, diminishing the crinkled appearance. Coating them right before baking keeps the sugar on the surface, allowing it to crack beautifully as the cookies bake. Apply a Generous Coating: Be generous with the powdered sugar. Make sure each dough ball is fully coated. A thick layer enhances the dramatic, crackly look as the cookies rise and spread. How to Store Baked Cookies: Baked cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days. To help maintain their freshness and softness, place a small piece of white bread in the container. How to Freeze Baked Cookies: Leftover baked cookies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store them in a freezer-safe bag. How to Store Unbaked Cookie Dough: Unbaked cookie dough can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze the dough for up to 3 months.

Quick, easy, and perfect for breakfast! Caramyn's Notes I've shared how to make over-easy , over-hard , and sunny-side-up eggs , but I've got to say that over-medium eggs are my favorite! They have firm yet tender whites and a jammy, slightly runny yolk. Over-medium eggs are perfect with buttered sourdough toast and homemade strawberry jam . Add maple turkey sausage or bacon for an easy quick and easy breakfast. Enjoy them with sourdough waffles or pancakes , or turn them into the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a toasted sourdough bagel or English muffin . This method is simple, reliable, and quick, making it my go-to for an easy breakfast any day of the week! Ingredients & Equipment Needed eggs : I opt for large, pasture-raised eggs—they bring out the best flavors. butter : I swear by butter for frying eggs; it gives them that unbeatable richness. Avocado oil, olive oil, or bacon grease can be used in place of butter. salt and pepper : A dash of salt and pepper is all they need to hit the spot—simple, flavorful, and perfect every time. skillet: A cast iron skillet is ideal for cooking eggs, but you can also use a non-stick skillet. How to Make Perfect Over-Medium Eggs Step 1: Melt the butter Melt the butter in a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes. Medium-low heat is typically around 2.5-3 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest setting and 10 is the highest. Step 2: Cook the egg Crack the egg on a flat surface and gently open it over the pan, ensuring the yolk doesn't break. (You can also break the egg into a small bowl before pouring it into the pan to help prevent the yolk from breaking.) Let the egg cook for 2-3 minutes until the whites are mostly set. Step 3: Flip the egg Using a thin, wide spatula, slide it gently under the egg, making sure to get under the yolk. In one smooth motion, quickly flip the egg over. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the yolk is jammy and slightly runny. Step 4: serve Gently slide the spatula under the egg, lift it from the pan, and carefully place it on a plate to serve. Season with salt and pepper. Pro Tips Preheat the pan: Heat the pan on medium-low and add butter, letting it melt for about 2 minutes before adding the egg. Cook on medium-low heat: Keep the heat medium-low to cook the egg evenly without burning the edges or overcooking the yolk. Use the right spatula: Use a thin, wide spatula to slide smoothly under the egg for easy flipping and serving. Avoid crowding: Cook only one or two eggs at a time to prevent them from blending together in the pan, so they cook evenly. Choose fresh eggs: Fresh eggs have stronger proteins in their whites, helping them hold their shape better while cooking compared to older eggs.

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish.

I would make sure the oven is preheated very well before baking. Reply My family requests this pie every holiday. I wasn't even a big apple pie fan, but this pie is delicious!

What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Other great varieties are: Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Jazz, Golden Delicious, Jonagold or Pink Lady. 4.99 from 805 votes ( 578 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe? Cancel reply 351 Comments Yup I made this. I love honey crisp apples too for preference, but the combo of apples goes a long way. Add some vanilla to the filling and it adds a nice touch. Reply Love this pie. It's my all time favorite.!!! Reply super easy the best and first apple pie I've made with my partner was super funn!!! Reply My family LOVED it … Reply This is absolutely the best Apple Pie ever!! Rather than the Granny Apples, I used Crisp Apples because that’s what I had on hand. I would probably use a little less sugar next time because crisp apples are sweet. This was simple and delicious. Thank You!

Tzatziki Sauce Jump to Recipe 1.5K shares Tzatziki sauce is a fresh, cool, creamy way to really liven up your summertime grilling! It’s an authentic tzatziki sauce recipe that is sure to be your new favorite! Everyone needs a good tzatziki recipe and this one is amazing! This recipe has a small ingredient list but it definitely packs a big flavor punch. It can be made in just a few easy steps and enjoyed for weeks. It's tangy, cool, and delicious and just tastes better and better the longer it hangs out in the fridge! This makes it perfect for party planning because you can make it ahead of time. It’s delicious with tortillas, pita bread, gyros, or grilled meat and veggies. Use it to dip raw veggies like celery, carrots, or tomatoes for a healthy snack. Or, enjoy alongside greek chicken kabobs and greek pasta salad or greek cauliflower rice for a tasty dinner. Ingredients needed Don’t let the small number of ingredients fool you. Tzatziki sauce is BIG on flavor and it adds a cool creaminess to a variety of different dishes. Greek Yogurt: Plain, full-fat Greek yogurt is the best for an authentic tzatziki recipe. Feel free to sub with non-fat if desired. Regular yogurt can be used but the sauce will not be as thick. Cucumber: English cucumbers or regular cucumbers can be used. See our tips section for how to grate them for the recipe. Garlic: Fresh garlic is a must! Adjust the amount to your preference. Vinegar: Red wine vinegar, white vinegar, or even apple cider vinegar can be used. The vinegar can be swapped with lemon juice. Olive Oil: Adds flavor and richness. Fresh Dill: Some people like dill, and some don't. Personally, it's one of my favorite herbs, but leave it out if you're not into it. Salt and Pepper: These two seasonings bring all the flavors together! How to make the best tzatziki Let's go over the basic steps on how to make tzatziki sauce from scratch and then we'll share some tips for making it the best you've ever had! Grate the cucumber using a cheese grater. Squeeze excess moisture from the grated cucumber and transfer it into a mixing bowl. Mince the fresh garlic using a knife or a garlic press. Add the greek yogurt, minced garlic, vinegar, olive oil, dill, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine, cover and chill for 2 hours. Tips for making the best tzatziki Cucumber contains mostly water so it's crucial that you remove as much excess moisture from the grated cucumber as possible. Use your hands to squeeze it and get as much out as you can. Let the dip chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours. The garlic flavor will start to mellow out and not be so pungent and sharp tasting. Use a garlic press to get the garlic pieces as small as possible. It will help to distribute the garlic flavor even more. After the tzatziki has had a chance to chill, give it a taste and add more salt and pepper if needed before serving. Make this a vegan or dairy-free tzatziki by using coconut yogurt instead of greek yogurt. Tzatziki can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks and in the freezer for up to 2 months.

" I'm super excited to have come across your site! Per your excellent instructions I have starter bubbling in a jar on the counter!! Thank you for helping me get started with sourdough baking!" Jennifer " Amy, I just wanted to thank you for teaching me how to make a starter, sourdough loaves, using the discard and how to store starter when absent for a period of time. My wife and I went on holiday overseas so I stored my starter. However, because of what you’ve taught me, I easily “awoke” my snoozing starter, and am now (impatiently!) waiting for my sourdough loaves to cool before I eat some much needed fresh delicious bread. Not to mention the fantastic crackers from the discard 😋. You’ve become something of a hero in our household!" Roddy " Hi Amy I truly appreciate your sample time schedule as it all seems overwhelming.....but you've done a superior job of explaining in simple detail each step. I've made your sourdough discard crackers and LOVE them! Very addictive! Thanks again!" Pamela " Hi Amy, After trying many sourdough starter recipes and wasting many 5 pound of flour bags, I stumbled across your Beginner's Sourdough Starter recipe about 10 days ago. Yesterday, on the 7th day of feeding, my starter passed the "Float" test. Yippppeeeeeeeeeee." Hannoush " Hi Amy! Your starter directions worked perfectly and I am ready to make my first loaf!"

It has a tender, flaky, homemade pie crust with apple slices drenched in sugar and warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. 4.99 from 805 votes Prep Time 1 hour hr Cook Time 1 hour hr Servings 8 Ingredients 1x 2x 3x ▢ 2 (9") pie crusts ▢ 7 large Granny Smith apples peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices ▢ ½ cup granulated sugar ▢ ½ cup light brown sugar loosely packed ▢ 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ▢ ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg ▢ 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus the zest of half of a lemon ▢ 1 large egg lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash ▢ 2 tablespoons sanding sugar optional Instructions Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

Vanilla pudding is folded into a thick, whipped cream that's been blended with cream cheese and then layered between slices of bananas and cookies. It's rich. It's creamy. And it's absolutely bursting with banana flavor! Ingredients needed There are 4 components to this amazing summertime dessert. Each one is made from scratch for the most decadent banana pudding you'll ever eat! Vanilla Pudding: Whole milk, sugar, tapioca starch, egg yolks, butter and vanilla extract. Non-GMO cornstarch can be used in place of tapioca starch. Homemade Gluten Free Nilla Wafers: Almond flour, tapioca starch, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda, butter, vanilla extract and egg. Whipped Cream: Heavy cream, cream cheese, sugar and cream of tartar. Bananas: Choose slightly ripened bananas. How to make gluten-free banana pudding from scratch Cook the pudding. Milk is whisked over medium heat with tapioca starch, sugar and a pinch of salt until it starts to thicken. Half of the mixture is poured into a separate bowl with egg yolks while whisking, in order to temper the eggs. It's poured back into the saucepan and cooked for one more minute. The pudding is removed from the heat and butter and vanilla are whisked in. Bake the wafers. Almond flour is combined with the remaining ingredients in a bowl until combined. After chilling for 30 minutes, the cookies are baked for 20 minutes in a 325°F oven. Make the whipped cream mixture. Homemade whipped cream is beaten with cream cheese. Assemble. The vanilla pudding and whipped cream are folded together and then layered between the gluten-free Nilla wafers and sliced bananas. Tips for Success The very first thing you need to do is get your pudding cooked and that's because you're going to want to let it cool down in the fridge so that it's nice and cold when you go to assemble everything. It's very important to temper the eggs correctly. This technique keeps the eggs from becoming scrambled from the heat of the milk as you pour it into the bowl. As soon as you start pouring the hot milk, start to whisk and don't stop until it's fully blended. It's easy! Make sure to let the cookie dough chill in the fridge to firm up before shaping them. This will make them much easier to handle. Feel free to substitute the homemade gluten-free Nilla wafers with store-bought if you don't feel like making them from scratch. Ideally, you’ll want to make this the day before you serve it. That way it can be nice and chilled when you’re ready to serve it. How to store Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to 2 days.

Chocolate Chip Cookies Jump to Recipe 1.0K shares Everyone needs the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe on hand when the mood strikes. These cookies are everything a chocolate chip cookie should be. Big, soft, chewy, sweet, a little salty and loaded with chocolate chips. Yum! The best chocolate chip cookies made from scratch I've been making this chocolate chip cookie recipe for my son for two decades. It's pretty safe to say that this is a tried and true recipe! When he was a kid, I would make a batch of cookie dough and keep it in the freezer. Anytime he was in the mood for cookies, we just grabbed a few dough balls out of the freezer and boom ... we had fresh out of the oven, chocolate chips cookies! He always claimed that his mom made the BEST chocolate chip cookies, hands down. But ... baker beware. You may just start calling them the worst chocolate chip cookies ever because these cookies are totally addictive! What makes a good chocolate chip cookie? Just like our sourdough chocolate chip cookies , big, bakery-style cookies are what we crave. The kind that are soft with chewy centers and loaded with semi-sweet chocolate chips! What you need The ingredients needed for perfect chocolate chip cookies are simple. all-purpose flour unsalted butter full-fat cream cheese light brown sugar granulated sugar vanilla extract eggs baking soda salt TIP: Baking soda is a leavening agent that may be inactive if it's been in your pantry for a while. Baking soda should be replaced every year to maintain effectiveness. If you don't bake often, check the box to make sure it hasn't expired. Here's a few ways to modify this recipe if needed. Pastry flour can be used in place of all-purpose flour. Salted butter can be used but make sure to reduce the salt called for in the recipe to ½ teaspoon. Light brown sugar can be replaced with granulated sugar. Because there is less moisture in granulated sugar than brown sugar, the cookies will turn out more crispy around the edges. If you don't have cream cheese on hand, replace it with butter. We do not recommend using fat-free cream cheese in this recipe. Equipment needed (Amazon affiliate links ) - Check out my favorite kitchen essentials . cast iron skillet mixing bowls How to make it In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients and set the bowl aside. Use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment to beat the butter , cream cheese, granulated sugar and light brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. 3-4 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the bowl and continue to beat until everything is well incorporated. TIP: Make sure the eggs are at room temperature before adding them to the dough. Cold eggs can cause the butter to solidify. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl of the stand mixer. Beat the dough on the slowest speed until everything is just incorporated. Do not over-mix. Gently stir the chocolate chips into the batter using a spatula. Cover the bowl OR measure out 2 tablespoon portions of dough, roll each into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow the dough to chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight. NOTE: The cookies can be baked right away but they will be thinner and more crispy than chewy. When you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Portion and shape the dough if you haven't already. Arrange the dough balls on the baking sheet 2 inches apart, 6 cookies per baking sheet. Bake the cookie dough for 11-12 minutes or until the edges are light golden brown and the center looks set. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies rest for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer them to a cooling rack. TIP: A cooling rack allows air to circulate around the cookies which will help them cool down quicker. If you do not have a cooling rack, lay the cookies on a paper towel to cool. How to store it Store baked chocolate chip cookies in an air-tight container, at room temperature, for up to 1 week. Keep unbaked cookie dough in an air-tight container, in the fridge for up to 5 days. Freeze baked chocolate chip cookies and you'll be able to enjoy a sweet treat anytime the mood strikes. Let the cookies cool completely and then stack them between layers of parchment or wax paper. Transfer the stacks to a freezer-safe container and place it in the freezer. The cookies will stay good for up to 6 months. Freeze raw cookie dough to bake up cookies in a jiffy. Frozen cookie dough is a lifesaver when chocolate chip cookie cravings start to kick in. Place the portioned dough onto a baking sheet and place the sheet in the freezer. After the dough balls are frozen solid, transfer them to a freezer-safe plastic bag. Store in the freezer for up to 9 months. There's no need to thaw frozen cookie dough before baking. Bake as directed in the recipe adding a few extra minutes of cooking time. Common questions Why are my chocolate chip cookies raw in the middle? Did you preheat the oven? Placing the cookie dough into an oven that is not preheated will result in an under-baked cookie. Also, make sure the oven rack is in the middle position so that the cookies bake evenly on top and bottom. Why do cookies spread and flatten? It's probably because the dough wasn't chilled. Chilling the dough solidifies the butter and cream cheese. The longer these fats stay solid in the oven, the less spreading will occur during baking. For the perfect cookie, let the dough chill in the fridge overnight. If you’re in pinch for time let chill a minimum of 2 hours if you want a thicker cookie. How do you make chewy cookies? Using a combination of brown and granulated sugar produces a chewier cookie. This is because brown sugar adds moisture to the dough. A cookie made with just granulated sugar will be more crispy than chewy. All that's left to do is grab a big glass of cold milk and someone you love!

Cancel reply 11 Comments There's something amiss worh this recipe. I made the cookies exactly as specified. They took way longer than 11-14 minutes and still not completely done but it said don't overcook so I took them out after about 18 minutes They were thick and looked okay. Cooled them on a rack. So, one thing there's too many chocolate chips so it's just overpowered with chocolate. Main thing is that they absolutely have no taste except chocolate chips. My family wont eat them. I wonder sometimes if they check recipes after they post them because this one is messed up. Try it yourself and see if I'm wrong, but it was a complete waste of time and money. Reply Hi Jude, Thank you for your feedback. I'm really sorry to hear that the recipe didn’t turn out as expected. We've tested this recipe many times with consistent results, so let's try to troubleshoot what might have gone wrong. If the cookies took longer to bake, it's possible your oven isn't reaching the set temperature. Ovens can run hot or cold without us realizing it, so we recommend checking yours with an oven thermometer to ensure it's properly calibrated. The cookies turning out too thick could also be due to too much flour. How did you measure your ingredients—using measuring cups or a kitchen scale? It's easy to accidentally add extra flour when using cups, especially if the flour is packed down. If you're using cups, the scoop-and-level method can help, but for the most accurate and consistent results, we always recommend using a kitchen scale. Also, if you found there were too many chocolate chips for your taste, that’s an easy fix! Feel free to reduce the amount next time. Please let us know if you try it again; we’d love to help you get the perfect batch! Carmyn Reply How long to bake chocolate chip cookies that are 1 T. of dough instead of 2T.? Should I still bake at 375? Reply Yes I would check them at 8-10 minutes. Reply Absolutely fantastic!! I love all your cookie recipes, cake recipes and soups. Reply Hi Can I replace the sugar with xylitol? Reply I haven't used xylitol with this recipe so I'm not sure that it would work.

Cancel reply 37 Comments I made this for a church dinner. Of course, as always, there were plenty of delicious desserts. I brought home an empty plate. Reply I see a lot of comments saying your cheesecake wasn't cooked inside. I've been making cheesecake for a long time now, it's the preferred dessert amongst my family, I always wrap my cheesecake pan in aluminum foil to ensure no water gets in it and I never use a 2nd cake pan. I put my wrapped springform pan directly in water bath, 1 hr in oven at 350° turn oven off and let sit in there for another hour with door cracked. Cheesecake when done should have a slight jiggle when shaken. I've also had trouble with oven temps, you can usually find oven thermometer at your grocery store for a few dollars to ensure your oven is heating and staying at temp. Also, I find instead of adding the oreos directly to the mix I layer it so there's no air forming. I do cheesecake layer, sprinkle oreos, cheesecake, oreos, cheesecake. Reply Hi. This is the first cheesecake that I’ve tried to make in 20 years. The one error I made was using 16 ounces of sour cream instead of just ate. But ChatGPT assured me that this wouldn’t make it runny. (lol) And for sure it didn’t. I did end up, baking it almost 2 hours even though I used a makeshift water bath. (I have a smaller oven that makes it challenging for baking pans inside of baking pans.) When it was all said and done, it actually turned out really good. My only complaint/issue about it is that the outside of the cheesecake seemed more mushy and less dense whereas the interior of the cheesecake was almost perfect. I think condensation built up between the springform pan and the sides and that’s why it was a little bit wetter/mushy. (And not a bad mushy just not as dense as the interior of the cheesecake is.) Thank you for all the details and going into the recipe. Having the success, has given me enough confidence to try it again. (after all, I specifically bought a springform pan to make this recipe 🙂 ) Reply The taste and proportions were fantastic! However, as posted by another user I found it needed to bake substantially longer or maybe at a higher temperature? The final baking temperature is 320F for an hour, correct? I used the water bath and the level was at least halfway up the side of the pan. The center of the cake ended up quite runny. Any ideas what might cause this or what I may have missed? Reply Mine was in for at least 2 hours. It was also my first time using a water bath and since I didn’t know to line the springform with aluminum foil the water leaked into the cheesecake. It didn’t matter anyway because it fell off the stove and became dessert for my dogs. Reply - Sourdough Recipes - Little Spoon Farm Here at Little Spoon Farm, we are passionate about sourdough.

Sourdough Pie Crust Jump to Recipe 34.3K shares Sourdough pie crust is buttery, flaky and tender. Made with your sourdough discard, this homemade pie crust can be used for both sweet or savory pie fillings. It's amazing what you can make with your sourdough starter . This recipe for pie crust is just one of many! Whether you want to make an old fashioned peanut butter pie , blueberry pie or sourdough pop tarts , you'll love how easily this dough comes together. This recipe makes 1 pie crust for a 9" pie. Make sure to double the ingredients if your recipe calls for a top and bottom crust. Step by step instructions The first step in making a flaky, buttery pie crust, is to cut the butter into the flour. I find it easy to achieve this with a cheese grater and a bench scraper. Grate the cold butter into a large mixing bowl and add the flour, salt and sugar. Toss the ingredients with a fork and then use the bench scraper to cut the butter into the flour until large crumbles form. (photo 1) Add the sourdough starter and vinegar to the mixture and use a fork to combine the wet and dry ingredients. The mixture will be clumpy. (photo 2) Use your hands to press the dough together until there are no more dry bits in the bowl. If the dough is too dry, add 1 teaspoon of ice water to help hydrate it. (photo 3) Quickly form the dough into a rough disk shape. (photo 4) Place the disk onto a piece of plastic wrap and use the plastic to help shape the dough. This will allow less transfer of heat from your hands and help to keep the butter as cold as possible. (photos 5 and 6) After the dough is wrapped in plastic, use a rolling pin to flatten the disk which will help to smooth the edges. (photo 7) Chill the dough for at least 2 hours or up to 4 days. How to roll pie crust dough When you are ready to bake your pie, remove the disk from the fridge and let rest on the counter at room temperature for 10 minutes. This will make the dough easier to roll out. Place the dough on a floured work surface and use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a circle with a â " thickness. It's best to start rolling the dough from the center, outwards, turning the pie crust 90° on the work surface after each roll. Don't be afraid to use enough flour as needed to help prevent sticking. Use the rolling pin to help lift the dough onto the pie plate. Use your hands to press the dough into the pie plate and then follow your pie recipes directions for baking. Some pie recipes call for only a bottom crust and others call for a top and bottom crust . If your recipe calls for a top and bottom crust, you will need to double the ingredients in this recipe. How to store and freeze pie crust Store the unbaked pie crust in the fridge, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap for up to 4 days . This sourdough pie crust can be made ahead of time and kept frozen for up to 3 months . Make sure to individually wrap each disk of dough tightly in plastic wrap. To help prevent freezer-burn, insert the wrapped dough into a freezer safe bag before freezing. Tips for success The sourdough starter used in this recipe is a 100% hydration starter. That means it is made of equal parts flour and water and is reflected in the ratios of dry to wet ingredients in the pie crust recipe. This is why some people might find they need to add a little ice water when bringing the dough together. When making pie crust, it's important to use cold ingredients to make sure the butter stays in pieces within the dough. These little bits of butter scattered through out the pie crust dough will burst while baking, producing a tender, flaky crust!

All Butter Pie Crust Jump to Recipe 4.0K shares This all butter pie crust recipe is made from scratch for the most tender and flaky pie crust ever! Just follow these easy, step-by-step instructions for the perfect pie crust, every single time! There's nothing like a big slice of homemade apple pie or creamy peanut butter pie to share with your friends and family. I promise it's not hard at all to make a delicious, flaky pie crust from scratch. Just like our sourdough pie crust , it's one hundred times better than anything that you can buy pre-made at the store! This all butter pie crust is versatile too. Use it to make sweet desserts like our blueberry pie or for a savory dish such as chicken pot pie. You'll love how quick and effortless it is to make your pie crust from scratch! Ingredients All-Purpose Flour: The best flour to use for pie crust is unbleached, all-purpose flour because of it's high protein content. Pastry flour is too delicate and whole wheat flour can be too grainy. Cold Unsalted Butter: I recommend using unsalted butter whenever you are baking so that you can control the salt levels in a recipe. Ice Water/Vinegar Mixture: Adding an acid to the dough creates a more tender crust. I use white vinegar for this recipe but you can substitute it with apple cider vinegar, lemon juice or vodka . Salt and Sugar: Fine sea salt and granulated sugar work best. Instructions Prepare the water & vinegar mixture. In a one cup liquid measuring cup, place one ice cube and fill with cold water until it reaches the ½ cup mark line. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and set aside. Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl and stir. Cut the cold butter into ¼" cubes. Use a fork to gently toss and coat them in the bowl with the flour mixture. (photo 1) Cut the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter (affiliate link) until the mixture forms large, coarse crumbs. (photo 2) Drizzle the ice water into the dry ingredients and toss with a fork until the dough is evenly moist. U se your hands to bring the ingredients together in the bottom of the bowl. (photo 3) Divide the dough in half and quickly form each into a disk shape. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 1 hour before rolling out. (photo 4) Tip: Add the ice water a few tablespoons at a time . Use just enough water for the dough to come together without being crumbly. This pie crust recipe can be used for both double crust pies and single crust pies. How to cut butter into flour with a rolling pin What if you don't have a pastry cutter? No problem! You can easily use a rolling pin to get the job done! Combine Dry Ingredients and Butter in a bowl. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. Toss the cold cubed butter in the flour mixture and then dump it all onto a clean work-surface. Roll butter into flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the butter into the flour mixture. (photo a) Cut butter into smaller pieces. Use a bench scraper to cut the butter into smaller pieces. Gather the mixture back into a tight circle and repeat 3 or 4 more times. (photo b) This will create thin ribbons of butter within the flour that will help to create a super flaky crust when baked. (photo c) Place mixture back into the bowl. Use the bench scraper to scoop the mixture up and back into the mixing bowl. Proceed with step 3 from instructions above .(photo d) Tip: We've discovered an even EASIER way to incorporate butter into a pie crust. Check out how we use a cheese grater to get fine ribbons of butter in our sourdough pie crust recipe! Tips for success Cold Ingredients. Always use cold butter and ice cold water when making pie crust. After you bring the dough together you'll see little spots of butter scattered throughout the dough. That's a good thing! These little chunks are what make the dough flaky during the baking process. Rolling out the Dough. Lightly flour your work surface and the rolling pin as needed to prevent sticking. Roll the dough out to a ⅛" thickness for the perfect pie crust! Use a pie shield to protect the edge of crust from over browning. Use it during the first 25 minutes of baking. You can create a DIY pie shield from a strip of aluminum foil that is about 38" long. Fold the foil in half lengthwise, and fold it in half lengthwise again to create a 38" x 3" strip. Storage Fridge. Keep the dough tightly wrapped in plastic, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freeze. You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Wrap each dough disk with a few layers of plastic wrap to avoid freezer burn. All-Butter Pie Crust An easy, all-butter pie crust recipe that gives you a tender, flaky pie crust every time!

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes Chill Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 2 (9") pie crusts Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour 1 cup unsalted butter (cold, cut into small cubes) 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar ½ cup cold water (plus one ice cube) 2 teaspoons vinegar (or apple cider vinegar) INSTRUCTIONS Prepare the water/vinegar mixture. Drop an ice-cube into a measuring cup and fill the measuring cup up with water to the ½ cup mark. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and set aside. Mix Flour and Butter. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar together in a medium sized bowl and toss with a fork to mix evenly. Add the cubed butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture forms large, coarse crumbs. Add Water. Pour the water mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into the flour/butter mixture and toss with a fork until the dough is evenly moist. Add water slowly to get the right texture. Gather the dough. Use your hands to quickly bring the dough together in the bowl. Do not over work the dough. Divide and Chill. Divide the dough in half and flatten into disks. Wrap the disks separately in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour . Bake according to what your pie recipe calls for. NOTES To Store: Dough can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. To Freeze: Wrap the dough in a few layers of plastic wrap and then put the wrapped dough into a freezer bag for up to 3 months. Form a Pie Shell: To form the pie shell, take a disk from the refrigerator and let rest for 5 minutes at room temperature. Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a 14 inch round. Wrap the dough over the rolling pin, pick it up and carefully unroll it over a 9 inch pie plate. Gently fit the pie into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to trim a 1 inch overhang. Fold the edges under and press to seal. To Freeze the pie shell: Place the pie shell into the refrigerator to chill and set for 1 hour. Wrap tightly with a few layers of plastic wrap and place in freezer until ready to bake. Store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Blind Bake: Place a piece of parchment paper or coffee filter into the center of the pie crust. Fill the center with pie weights or dry beans to keep the dough from puffing up while baking. Chill for 30 minutes. Bake the crust at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and carefully lift out the paper and weights. Prick the bottom of the crust using a fork to prevent bubbles, return to the oven for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust is golden all over.

I've used this on many types of pies, and I always get compliments from my friends and family! Thank you! Reply This says for "two pie crusts". It that two full closed pies (base and lid). Or two pastry circles, which can be either two bases or one base and lid? Reply Yes it makes two 9 inch pie crust, so you can have a top and bottom crust, or two bottom crusts. Reply I have been trying to get a apple pie recipe. Now that I have one, I'm going to the kitchen right now to make it. Will .et you know ow after I have made it. Thank you Eunice Boynton Reply I don’t know what I did wrong but the crust was maybe too thick? It was beautiful but really too hard to cut into. Help! Reply Hi Linda, usually when a pie crust has issues, it's due to the dough being over-worked and too much gluten development. Reply Excellent pie dough! My father, who only loves his mother's apple pie, LOVED it. That is like winning the pie contest of all time. And, it was so ridiculously easy. I made the dough and prepared the peeled the apples the night before. Kept the apples in ice water and lemon juice over night in the fridge. Prepared the apple mixture, assembled the pie and baked it in the morning and it was a scrumptious breakfast treat. I'm sure it will be gone before dinner. Reply Thank you for excellent instructions. I've always assumed I would mess it up by "over working the dough." Because I didn't know what that meant. You instructions explains that there SHOULD be butter clumps in the crust. So I thought, I'm just going to cut the butter as small as I can, not worry about mixing in the butter, then add just enough cold water/vinegar to get it to stick together and see what happens. My dough was totally lumpy, but I had the guts to ignore it and it was fine! I won't say it was expert level, but way way way way better than store bought and that's what I was doing before. Thank you for giving me the guts to try it! Reply This was so easy to make. I’m always intimidated by pie crusts and this one came out perfect. Used it for apple and pumpkin! Reply Just prepared the dough and it is chilling. Amazed how easy that was! When would you utilize «blind bake»?

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes Cook Time: 1 hour hour 15 minutes minutes Chill Time for Crust: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 1 (9") unbaked pie crust (homemade or store-bought) 1 cup corn syrup (light or dark) 3 large eggs ¾ cup granulated sugar 1 ½ cups chopped pecans 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon flour 1 teaspoon vanilla extract INSTRUCTIONS Pie Crust (Homemade) Prepare the homemade pie crust as directed and let the dough chill for 1 hour in the fridge.

Bake the pie for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the edges of the pie filling are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Tent a piece of foil over the pie during the last 10-15 minutes to prevent the pecans and crust from over-browning. (You'll know that the pie is done when the edges of the filling are set and the center is slightly jiggly, like "jello", when you move the pie plate.) Remove the pie and let cool completely, at least 2 hours, before slicing so that the pie filling sets up properly. Nutrition Calories: 476 kcal | Carbohydrates: 66 g | Protein: 6 g | Fat: 24 g Common questions How do you know when a pecan pie is set? The edges of the filling should be completely set and the center should give you a slight jiggle, like "jello", when you move the pie plate. If the middle of the pie is "wavy" when you jiggle it, it needs more time! Why is my pecan pie runny? A lot of people have this issue, including me! To remedy this problem, I add flour to the filling to thicken it. You could also try using cornstarch in place of flour. Can pecan pie be made ahead of time? Yes, this is a great pie recipe to make ahead of time. Let the pie cool completely, cover loosely, and store in the fridge until ready to serve. Is light or dark Karo syrup better for pecan pie? Either light or dark Karo syrup can be used for making pecan pie. Dark corn syrup will give the filling a darker golden color and a slightly richer flavor. 5 from 17 votes ( 14 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe?

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves.

When placing the apple mixture into the pie crust, make sure to spoon the apples out of the bowl and discard any excess liquid that is in the bottom of the bowl. The extra liquid can cause the crust to become soggy. The apples will continue to release moisture as the pie bakes. Should I cook apples before making pie? There is no need to cook apples before making the pie. The apples will cook during the baking process. How do I freeze a baked apple pie? Let the baked pie cool completely and then place in the freezer, uncovered. When completely frozen, tightly wrap the pie in a few layers of plastic wrap. You can also use a large freezer bag. A baked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 4 months. When you are ready to serve, let the pie thaw at room temperature for one hour. Reheat the pie in the oven at 375°F on the lowest oven rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. How do I freeze an unbaked apple pie? An unbaked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months. Follow steps 1-7 of the recipe, except DO NOT cut vents in the top of the pie crust. Place the unbaked pie in the freezer, uncovered. After one hour, remove from the freezer, tightly wrap with plastic wrap or use a plastic freezer bag. Freezing the unbaked pie before wrapping will help keep the shape of the dough around the edges. When you're ready to bake, do not thaw. Cut vents in the top of the crust and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F and bake an additional 35-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the juice begins to bubble. What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Other great varieties are: Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Jazz, Golden Delicious, Jonagold or Pink Lady. 4.99 from 805 votes ( 578 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe?

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar.

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

When placing the apple mixture into the pie crust, make sure to spoon the apples out of the bowl and discard any excess liquid that is in the bottom of the bowl. The extra liquid can cause the crust to become soggy. The apples will continue to release moisture as the pie bakes. Should I cook apples before making pie? There is no need to cook apples before making the pie. The apples will cook during the baking process. How do I freeze a baked apple pie? Let the baked pie cool completely and then place in the freezer, uncovered. When completely frozen, tightly wrap the pie in a few layers of plastic wrap. You can also use a large freezer bag. A baked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 4 months. When you are ready to serve, let the pie thaw at room temperature for one hour. Reheat the pie in the oven at 375°F on the lowest oven rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. How do I freeze an unbaked apple pie? An unbaked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months. Follow steps 1-7 of the recipe, except DO NOT cut vents in the top of the pie crust. Place the unbaked pie in the freezer, uncovered. After one hour, remove from the freezer, tightly wrap with plastic wrap or use a plastic freezer bag. Freezing the unbaked pie before wrapping will help keep the shape of the dough around the edges. When you're ready to bake, do not thaw. Cut vents in the top of the crust and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F and bake an additional 35-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the juice begins to bubble. What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Other great varieties are: Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Jazz, Golden Delicious, Jonagold or Pink Lady. 4.99 from 805 votes ( 578 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe?

Strawberry Icebox Cake Jump to Recipe 541 shares Strawberry icebox cake is a refreshing summer dessert made from scratch in under 30 minutes with layers of juicy strawberries, fluffy whipped cream, and graham crackers. It's perfect for BBQs, potlucks, and Fourth of July parties! Amy's Notes I can’t get enough of fresh strawberries when they’re in season, especially paired with heavy cream! This easy strawberry icebox cake has layers of strawberries, whipped cream, and graham crackers. Make it quick with store-bought graham crackers and whipped cream, or go all out from scratch using our homemade versions! Chill the icebox cake for a few hours and serve the same day, or make it up to 2 days ahead for a stress-free dessert! The recipe fills an 8" x 8" dish but can easily be doubled for a crowd. Enjoy! Ingredients Needed Strawberries : Choose bright red, ripe strawberries for the best berries and cream experience! Whipped Cream : Our whipped cream recipe uses heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cream of tartar. If you don’t have powdered sugar, you can blend regular white sugar until it turns powdery. Cream of tartar helps stabilize the whipped cream, but if you leave it out, the recipe will still work; your whipped cream won't stay as stiff over time. Graham Crackers : Use store-bought graham crackers or make your own with your sourdough starter . We have an easy sourdough graham cracker that you can use with this ice box cake, or to make graham cracker crusts, s'mores, and more! How to Make Strawberry Icebox Cake from Scratch Step 1 Bake the graham crackers. Follow our recipe for sourdough graham crackers if you would like to make them from scratch. If you are using store-bought graham crackers you may skip this step. Step 2 Make the whipped cream. Beat the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Pop the bowl in the fridge to chill until you are ready to assemble the dessert. Step 3 Prepare the strawberries. Wash the strawberries and remove the stems. Cut them into thin even slices. Step 4 Assemble. Place a very thin layer of whipped cream on the bottom of the dish. Layer the ingredients, starting with the graham crackers, whipped cream, and strawberries. Repeat for a second layer. Cover the dish and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, overnight is better. How to Store Make Ahead: You can assemble the dessert up to 2 days ahead of time and keep it covered in the fridge until you are ready to serve it. How to Store: Any leftover strawberry icebox cake can be stored in the fridge, covered, for up to 2 days. How to Freeze: If you'd like to freeze the icebox cake, ensure it is in a freezer-safe container and keep it frozen for up to 30 days. When you're ready to eat it, remove it from the freezer and allow it to thaw until it's easy to slice. Easy Dessert recipes - SUBSCRIBE - Do you like this recipe?

Made this last night after notice of an unexpected guest/dinner this evening. Had 3/4 lb of fresh berries, cream and pantry grahams on hand, so I took a shot at redemption and tossed it together beforehand. This came together in a snap! I was so concerned since the berries are not totally in season yet and still a bit tart. Also not sure how the grahams would soften up (or not?) Used an oval-ish clay dish about 5 .1/2" x 8" . Do not hesitate to make this! It was absolute bliss - kind of like a cheesecake type treat! The whipped cream brought the berries to life, and grahams anchored the whole thing in total yummy bliss. Forget about pretty square portions, lol! I started that way and I think it would be more successful with a true square pan, but my choice of smaller dish to fit the available ingredients made a large spoon necessary. Honestly, when you are serving a homemade treat like this, it just doesn't matter! The deserves a zillion stars, and can easily be made with blueberries, raspberries, etc! Great for a riff, but superior on it's own! Held perfectly for 30 hrs before serving with zero seeping/weeping or whatever. I think this would even go up to the sophisticated notch by rough-breaking the grahams and layering it nice goblet glasses for special guest desserts. A few dark chocolate shaves on top and you are the queen! Reply Can I make it with raspberries? Reply Hi De, we haven't tested this recipe with raspberries but I don't see why not! Sounds delicious 🙂 Reply Very good Reply Thanks Amy. I can’t wait to make this tonight Reply So excited to try! Looks delicious!

Sourdough Lemon Crinkle Cookies Jump to Recipe 340 shares Just like sourdough chocolate crinkle cookies , these sourdough lemon crinkle cookies are soft, chewy, and easy to make with sourdough discard. They’re bursting with tangy lemon flavor and absolutely delicious! Carmyn's notes Say hello to my new seasonal obsession: sourdough lemon crinkle cookies! They're the sunny, zesty twist on our classic chocolate crinkle favorites and honestly, I'm so in love. They're light, lemony, and seriously easy to whip up! For foolproof sourdough lemon crinkle cookies, here are some pro tips to keep in mind: Room Temp Ingredients : Let your egg and sourdough discard come to room temp before mixing. This helps the dough mix up nice and smooth. Go Fresh with Lemon : Freshly squeezed lemon juice makes all the difference! It’s brighter and tastier than the bottled stuff. Chill the Dough : Pop the dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours (or overnight). It’s easier to roll and gives you that classic crinkle look. Sugar Coat Last Minute : Roll the dough in powdered sugar right before baking so it stays on the surface and cracks beautifully. Be Generous : Coat those dough balls well. More sugar means a better crinkle! Happy baking! xx Ingredients & Equipment Needed Dry Ingredients: You'll need all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Wet Ingredients : You'll need sourdough discard , butter , granulated sugar, one egg, vanilla extract, fresh lemon juice and lemon zest. Rolling: You'll need about ¼ cup or more of powdered sugar to roll the cookie dough in to get that classic crinkle cookie look. How to Make Sourdough Lemon Crinkle Cookies Step 1 Whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside. Step 2 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sourdough discard, butter, granulated sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and lemon juice plus their zest. Step 3 Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and mix with a baking spatula. The dough will be thick. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Do not skip chilling the dough. It is mandatory for the next steps. Step 4 Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add the powdered sugar to a plate. Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop and roll the dough into balls using your hands (about 1.5-2 tablespoons of dough or about 30 grams each). Roll each ball very generously in the powdered sugar. Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Step 5 Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes Step 6 Let them cool slightly on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. How to Store How to Store : Baked cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days. To help maintain their freshness and softness, place a small piece of white bread in the container. How to Freeze: Leftover baked cookies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store them in a freezer-safe bag. Unbaked Cookie Dough : Unbaked cookie dough can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze the dough for up to 3 months.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 10 minutes minutes Cook Time: 11 minutes minutes Servings: 24 cookies Author: Carmyn Suzor Before You Begin Read the NOTES section after the instructions for tips, substitutions, and other helpful info to ensure the best results! INGREDIENTS Dry Ingredients 2 cups + 2 tablespoons ( 270 g ) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ( 4 g ) baking powder ½ teaspoon ( 3 g ) fine sea salt Wet Ingredients ¼ cup ( 50 g ) sourdough discard 4 tablespoons ( 56 g ) melted butter 1 cup ( 200 g ) granulated sugar 1 egg ½ teaspoon ( 2 g ) vanilla extract 3 tablespoons lemon juice + zest (3 small lemons) Rolling ¼ cup ( 30 g ) powdered sugar (you may need more) INSTRUCTIONS In a bowl, whisk together 2 cups + 2 tablespoons ( 270 g ) all-purpose flour , 1 teaspoon ( 4 g ) baking powder , and ½ teaspoon ( 3 g ) fine sea salt and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together ¼ cup ( 50 g ) sourdough discard , 4 tablespoons ( 56 g ) melted butter , 1 cup ( 200 g ) granulated sugar , 1 egg , ½ teaspoon ( 2 g ) vanilla extract , and 3 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of all the lemons. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and mix with a baking spatula. The dough will be thick. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Do not skip chilling the dough. It is mandatory for the next steps. Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add ¼ cup ( 30 g ) powdered sugar to a plate. Using a cookie scoop, scoop and roll the dough into balls using your hands (about 1.5-2 tablespoons of dough or about 30 grams each). Roll each ball very generously in the powdered sugar. Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. NOTES Use Room Temperature Ingredients: Ensure your egg and sourdough discard are at room temperature before mixing. This helps the dough come together smoothly and creates a more even texture. Use Fresh Lemon Juice: Opt for freshly squeezed lemon juice rather than the bottled kind. Fresh juice provides a brighter, more vibrant flavor while bottled lemon juice will altar the taste. Chill the Dough: Chilling the dough is essential for achieving that classic crinkle effect. Let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to make it easier to handle and roll into balls. Coat Right Before Baking: Roll the cookie dough balls in sugar just before baking. If done too early, the powdered sugar may absorb into the dough, diminishing the crinkled appearance. Coating them right before baking keeps the sugar on the surface, allowing it to crack beautifully as the cookies bake. Apply a Generous Coating: Be generous with the powdered sugar. Make sure each dough ball is fully coated. A thick layer enhances the dramatic, crackly look as the cookies rise and spread. How to Store Baked Cookies: Baked cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days. To help maintain their freshness and softness, place a small piece of white bread in the container. How to Freeze Baked Cookies: Leftover baked cookies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store them in a freezer-safe bag. How to Store Unbaked Cookie Dough: Unbaked cookie dough can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze the dough for up to 3 months.

Quick, easy, and perfect for breakfast! Caramyn's Notes I've shared how to make over-easy , over-hard , and sunny-side-up eggs , but I've got to say that over-medium eggs are my favorite! They have firm yet tender whites and a jammy, slightly runny yolk. Over-medium eggs are perfect with buttered sourdough toast and homemade strawberry jam . Add maple turkey sausage or bacon for an easy quick and easy breakfast. Enjoy them with sourdough waffles or pancakes , or turn them into the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a toasted sourdough bagel or English muffin . This method is simple, reliable, and quick, making it my go-to for an easy breakfast any day of the week! Ingredients & Equipment Needed eggs : I opt for large, pasture-raised eggs—they bring out the best flavors. butter : I swear by butter for frying eggs; it gives them that unbeatable richness. Avocado oil, olive oil, or bacon grease can be used in place of butter. salt and pepper : A dash of salt and pepper is all they need to hit the spot—simple, flavorful, and perfect every time. skillet: A cast iron skillet is ideal for cooking eggs, but you can also use a non-stick skillet. How to Make Perfect Over-Medium Eggs Step 1: Melt the butter Melt the butter in a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes. Medium-low heat is typically around 2.5-3 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest setting and 10 is the highest. Step 2: Cook the egg Crack the egg on a flat surface and gently open it over the pan, ensuring the yolk doesn't break. (You can also break the egg into a small bowl before pouring it into the pan to help prevent the yolk from breaking.) Let the egg cook for 2-3 minutes until the whites are mostly set. Step 3: Flip the egg Using a thin, wide spatula, slide it gently under the egg, making sure to get under the yolk. In one smooth motion, quickly flip the egg over. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the yolk is jammy and slightly runny. Step 4: serve Gently slide the spatula under the egg, lift it from the pan, and carefully place it on a plate to serve. Season with salt and pepper. Pro Tips Preheat the pan: Heat the pan on medium-low and add butter, letting it melt for about 2 minutes before adding the egg. Cook on medium-low heat: Keep the heat medium-low to cook the egg evenly without burning the edges or overcooking the yolk. Use the right spatula: Use a thin, wide spatula to slide smoothly under the egg for easy flipping and serving. Avoid crowding: Cook only one or two eggs at a time to prevent them from blending together in the pan, so they cook evenly. Choose fresh eggs: Fresh eggs have stronger proteins in their whites, helping them hold their shape better while cooking compared to older eggs.

Juicy apple slices are coated in sugar and spices and then baked to perfection inside a flaky homemade pie crust. No need to worry about mushy apples or a soggy pie crust because this apple pie bakes to perfection every single time! Just like a good pumpkin pie or pecan pie , we all need an easy to make apple pie recipe. Whether you want to serve a classic holiday dessert for your Thanksgiving or Christmas gathering or, you're just in the mood for the irresistible taste of cinnamon and apples, I guarantee you've found yours here! What you need pie crust apples granulated sugar brown sugar flour cinnamon nutmeg lemon egg Equipment needed for making pie (Amazon affiliate links ) - Check out my favorite kitchen essentials . 9" pie plate rolling pin parchment paper whisk spatula pie weights or dried beans pie shield or foil mixing bowls measuring cups and spoons When it comes to the perfect apple pie there are 2 questions you need to ask. What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes.

Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in.

Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes.

How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling.

A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes.

The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly.

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Use your hands to squeeze it and get as much out as you can. Let the dip chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours. The garlic flavor will start to mellow out and not be so pungent and sharp tasting. Use a garlic press to get the garlic pieces as small as possible. It will help to distribute the garlic flavor even more. After the tzatziki has had a chance to chill, give it a taste and add more salt and pepper if needed before serving. Make this a vegan or dairy-free tzatziki by using coconut yogurt instead of greek yogurt. Tzatziki can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks and in the freezer for up to 2 months.

" I'm super excited to have come across your site! Per your excellent instructions I have starter bubbling in a jar on the counter!! Thank you for helping me get started with sourdough baking!" Jennifer " Amy, I just wanted to thank you for teaching me how to make a starter, sourdough loaves, using the discard and how to store starter when absent for a period of time. My wife and I went on holiday overseas so I stored my starter. However, because of what you’ve taught me, I easily “awoke” my snoozing starter, and am now (impatiently!) waiting for my sourdough loaves to cool before I eat some much needed fresh delicious bread. Not to mention the fantastic crackers from the discard 😋. You’ve become something of a hero in our household!" Roddy " Hi Amy I truly appreciate your sample time schedule as it all seems overwhelming.....but you've done a superior job of explaining in simple detail each step. I've made your sourdough discard crackers and LOVE them! Very addictive! Thanks again!" Pamela " Hi Amy, After trying many sourdough starter recipes and wasting many 5 pound of flour bags, I stumbled across your Beginner's Sourdough Starter recipe about 10 days ago. Yesterday, on the 7th day of feeding, my starter passed the "Float" test. Yippppeeeeeeeeeee." Hannoush " Hi Amy! Your starter directions worked perfectly and I am ready to make my first loaf!"

It has a tender, flaky, homemade pie crust with apple slices drenched in sugar and warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. 4.99 from 805 votes Prep Time 1 hour hr Cook Time 1 hour hr Servings 8 Ingredients 1x 2x 3x ▢ 2 (9") pie crusts ▢ 7 large Granny Smith apples peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices ▢ ½ cup granulated sugar ▢ ½ cup light brown sugar loosely packed ▢ 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ▢ ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg ▢ 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus the zest of half of a lemon ▢ 1 large egg lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash ▢ 2 tablespoons sanding sugar optional Instructions Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

Vanilla pudding is folded into a thick, whipped cream that's been blended with cream cheese and then layered between slices of bananas and cookies. It's rich. It's creamy. And it's absolutely bursting with banana flavor! Ingredients needed There are 4 components to this amazing summertime dessert. Each one is made from scratch for the most decadent banana pudding you'll ever eat! Vanilla Pudding: Whole milk, sugar, tapioca starch, egg yolks, butter and vanilla extract. Non-GMO cornstarch can be used in place of tapioca starch. Homemade Gluten Free Nilla Wafers: Almond flour, tapioca starch, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda, butter, vanilla extract and egg. Whipped Cream: Heavy cream, cream cheese, sugar and cream of tartar. Bananas: Choose slightly ripened bananas. How to make gluten-free banana pudding from scratch Cook the pudding. Milk is whisked over medium heat with tapioca starch, sugar and a pinch of salt until it starts to thicken. Half of the mixture is poured into a separate bowl with egg yolks while whisking, in order to temper the eggs. It's poured back into the saucepan and cooked for one more minute. The pudding is removed from the heat and butter and vanilla are whisked in. Bake the wafers. Almond flour is combined with the remaining ingredients in a bowl until combined. After chilling for 30 minutes, the cookies are baked for 20 minutes in a 325°F oven. Make the whipped cream mixture. Homemade whipped cream is beaten with cream cheese. Assemble. The vanilla pudding and whipped cream are folded together and then layered between the gluten-free Nilla wafers and sliced bananas. Tips for Success The very first thing you need to do is get your pudding cooked and that's because you're going to want to let it cool down in the fridge so that it's nice and cold when you go to assemble everything. It's very important to temper the eggs correctly. This technique keeps the eggs from becoming scrambled from the heat of the milk as you pour it into the bowl. As soon as you start pouring the hot milk, start to whisk and don't stop until it's fully blended. It's easy! Make sure to let the cookie dough chill in the fridge to firm up before shaping them. This will make them much easier to handle. Feel free to substitute the homemade gluten-free Nilla wafers with store-bought if you don't feel like making them from scratch. Ideally, you’ll want to make this the day before you serve it. That way it can be nice and chilled when you’re ready to serve it. How to store Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to 2 days.

Chocolate Chip Cookies Jump to Recipe 1.0K shares Everyone needs the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe on hand when the mood strikes. These cookies are everything a chocolate chip cookie should be. Big, soft, chewy, sweet, a little salty and loaded with chocolate chips. Yum! The best chocolate chip cookies made from scratch I've been making this chocolate chip cookie recipe for my son for two decades. It's pretty safe to say that this is a tried and true recipe! When he was a kid, I would make a batch of cookie dough and keep it in the freezer. Anytime he was in the mood for cookies, we just grabbed a few dough balls out of the freezer and boom ... we had fresh out of the oven, chocolate chips cookies! He always claimed that his mom made the BEST chocolate chip cookies, hands down. But ... baker beware. You may just start calling them the worst chocolate chip cookies ever because these cookies are totally addictive! What makes a good chocolate chip cookie? Just like our sourdough chocolate chip cookies , big, bakery-style cookies are what we crave. The kind that are soft with chewy centers and loaded with semi-sweet chocolate chips! What you need The ingredients needed for perfect chocolate chip cookies are simple. all-purpose flour unsalted butter full-fat cream cheese light brown sugar granulated sugar vanilla extract eggs baking soda salt TIP: Baking soda is a leavening agent that may be inactive if it's been in your pantry for a while. Baking soda should be replaced every year to maintain effectiveness. If you don't bake often, check the box to make sure it hasn't expired. Here's a few ways to modify this recipe if needed. Pastry flour can be used in place of all-purpose flour. Salted butter can be used but make sure to reduce the salt called for in the recipe to ½ teaspoon. Light brown sugar can be replaced with granulated sugar. Because there is less moisture in granulated sugar than brown sugar, the cookies will turn out more crispy around the edges. If you don't have cream cheese on hand, replace it with butter. We do not recommend using fat-free cream cheese in this recipe. Equipment needed (Amazon affiliate links ) - Check out my favorite kitchen essentials . cast iron skillet mixing bowls How to make it In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients and set the bowl aside. Use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment to beat the butter , cream cheese, granulated sugar and light brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. 3-4 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the bowl and continue to beat until everything is well incorporated. TIP: Make sure the eggs are at room temperature before adding them to the dough. Cold eggs can cause the butter to solidify. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl of the stand mixer. Beat the dough on the slowest speed until everything is just incorporated. Do not over-mix. Gently stir the chocolate chips into the batter using a spatula. Cover the bowl OR measure out 2 tablespoon portions of dough, roll each into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow the dough to chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight. NOTE: The cookies can be baked right away but they will be thinner and more crispy than chewy. When you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Portion and shape the dough if you haven't already. Arrange the dough balls on the baking sheet 2 inches apart, 6 cookies per baking sheet. Bake the cookie dough for 11-12 minutes or until the edges are light golden brown and the center looks set. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies rest for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer them to a cooling rack. TIP: A cooling rack allows air to circulate around the cookies which will help them cool down quicker. If you do not have a cooling rack, lay the cookies on a paper towel to cool. How to store it Store baked chocolate chip cookies in an air-tight container, at room temperature, for up to 1 week. Keep unbaked cookie dough in an air-tight container, in the fridge for up to 5 days. Freeze baked chocolate chip cookies and you'll be able to enjoy a sweet treat anytime the mood strikes. Let the cookies cool completely and then stack them between layers of parchment or wax paper. Transfer the stacks to a freezer-safe container and place it in the freezer. The cookies will stay good for up to 6 months. Freeze raw cookie dough to bake up cookies in a jiffy. Frozen cookie dough is a lifesaver when chocolate chip cookie cravings start to kick in. Place the portioned dough onto a baking sheet and place the sheet in the freezer. After the dough balls are frozen solid, transfer them to a freezer-safe plastic bag. Store in the freezer for up to 9 months. There's no need to thaw frozen cookie dough before baking. Bake as directed in the recipe adding a few extra minutes of cooking time. Common questions Why are my chocolate chip cookies raw in the middle? Did you preheat the oven? Placing the cookie dough into an oven that is not preheated will result in an under-baked cookie. Also, make sure the oven rack is in the middle position so that the cookies bake evenly on top and bottom. Why do cookies spread and flatten? It's probably because the dough wasn't chilled. Chilling the dough solidifies the butter and cream cheese. The longer these fats stay solid in the oven, the less spreading will occur during baking. For the perfect cookie, let the dough chill in the fridge overnight. If you’re in pinch for time let chill a minimum of 2 hours if you want a thicker cookie. How do you make chewy cookies? Using a combination of brown and granulated sugar produces a chewier cookie. This is because brown sugar adds moisture to the dough. A cookie made with just granulated sugar will be more crispy than chewy. All that's left to do is grab a big glass of cold milk and someone you love!

Cancel reply 11 Comments There's something amiss worh this recipe. I made the cookies exactly as specified. They took way longer than 11-14 minutes and still not completely done but it said don't overcook so I took them out after about 18 minutes They were thick and looked okay. Cooled them on a rack. So, one thing there's too many chocolate chips so it's just overpowered with chocolate. Main thing is that they absolutely have no taste except chocolate chips. My family wont eat them. I wonder sometimes if they check recipes after they post them because this one is messed up. Try it yourself and see if I'm wrong, but it was a complete waste of time and money. Reply Hi Jude, Thank you for your feedback. I'm really sorry to hear that the recipe didn’t turn out as expected. We've tested this recipe many times with consistent results, so let's try to troubleshoot what might have gone wrong. If the cookies took longer to bake, it's possible your oven isn't reaching the set temperature. Ovens can run hot or cold without us realizing it, so we recommend checking yours with an oven thermometer to ensure it's properly calibrated. The cookies turning out too thick could also be due to too much flour. How did you measure your ingredients—using measuring cups or a kitchen scale? It's easy to accidentally add extra flour when using cups, especially if the flour is packed down. If you're using cups, the scoop-and-level method can help, but for the most accurate and consistent results, we always recommend using a kitchen scale. Also, if you found there were too many chocolate chips for your taste, that’s an easy fix! Feel free to reduce the amount next time. Please let us know if you try it again; we’d love to help you get the perfect batch! Carmyn Reply How long to bake chocolate chip cookies that are 1 T. of dough instead of 2T.? Should I still bake at 375? Reply Yes I would check them at 8-10 minutes. Reply Absolutely fantastic!! I love all your cookie recipes, cake recipes and soups.

Cancel reply 37 Comments I made this for a church dinner. Of course, as always, there were plenty of delicious desserts. I brought home an empty plate. Reply I see a lot of comments saying your cheesecake wasn't cooked inside. I've been making cheesecake for a long time now, it's the preferred dessert amongst my family, I always wrap my cheesecake pan in aluminum foil to ensure no water gets in it and I never use a 2nd cake pan. I put my wrapped springform pan directly in water bath, 1 hr in oven at 350° turn oven off and let sit in there for another hour with door cracked. Cheesecake when done should have a slight jiggle when shaken. I've also had trouble with oven temps, you can usually find oven thermometer at your grocery store for a few dollars to ensure your oven is heating and staying at temp. Also, I find instead of adding the oreos directly to the mix I layer it so there's no air forming. I do cheesecake layer, sprinkle oreos, cheesecake, oreos, cheesecake. Reply Hi. This is the first cheesecake that I’ve tried to make in 20 years. The one error I made was using 16 ounces of sour cream instead of just ate. But ChatGPT assured me that this wouldn’t make it runny. (lol) And for sure it didn’t. I did end up, baking it almost 2 hours even though I used a makeshift water bath. (I have a smaller oven that makes it challenging for baking pans inside of baking pans.) When it was all said and done, it actually turned out really good. My only complaint/issue about it is that the outside of the cheesecake seemed more mushy and less dense whereas the interior of the cheesecake was almost perfect. I think condensation built up between the springform pan and the sides and that’s why it was a little bit wetter/mushy. (And not a bad mushy just not as dense as the interior of the cheesecake is.) Thank you for all the details and going into the recipe. Having the success, has given me enough confidence to try it again. (after all, I specifically bought a springform pan to make this recipe 🙂 ) Reply The taste and proportions were fantastic! However, as posted by another user I found it needed to bake substantially longer or maybe at a higher temperature? The final baking temperature is 320F for an hour, correct? I used the water bath and the level was at least halfway up the side of the pan. The center of the cake ended up quite runny. Any ideas what might cause this or what I may have missed? Reply Mine was in for at least 2 hours. It was also my first time using a water bath and since I didn’t know to line the springform with aluminum foil the water leaked into the cheesecake. It didn’t matter anyway because it fell off the stove and became dessert for my dogs. Reply - Sourdough Recipes - Little Spoon Farm Here at Little Spoon Farm, we are passionate about sourdough.

Sourdough Pie Crust Jump to Recipe 34.3K shares Sourdough pie crust is buttery, flaky and tender. Made with your sourdough discard, this homemade pie crust can be used for both sweet or savory pie fillings. It's amazing what you can make with your sourdough starter . This recipe for pie crust is just one of many! Whether you want to make an old fashioned peanut butter pie , blueberry pie or sourdough pop tarts , you'll love how easily this dough comes together. This recipe makes 1 pie crust for a 9" pie. Make sure to double the ingredients if your recipe calls for a top and bottom crust. Step by step instructions The first step in making a flaky, buttery pie crust, is to cut the butter into the flour. I find it easy to achieve this with a cheese grater and a bench scraper. Grate the cold butter into a large mixing bowl and add the flour, salt and sugar. Toss the ingredients with a fork and then use the bench scraper to cut the butter into the flour until large crumbles form. (photo 1) Add the sourdough starter and vinegar to the mixture and use a fork to combine the wet and dry ingredients. The mixture will be clumpy. (photo 2) Use your hands to press the dough together until there are no more dry bits in the bowl. If the dough is too dry, add 1 teaspoon of ice water to help hydrate it. (photo 3) Quickly form the dough into a rough disk shape. (photo 4) Place the disk onto a piece of plastic wrap and use the plastic to help shape the dough. This will allow less transfer of heat from your hands and help to keep the butter as cold as possible. (photos 5 and 6) After the dough is wrapped in plastic, use a rolling pin to flatten the disk which will help to smooth the edges. (photo 7) Chill the dough for at least 2 hours or up to 4 days. How to roll pie crust dough When you are ready to bake your pie, remove the disk from the fridge and let rest on the counter at room temperature for 10 minutes. This will make the dough easier to roll out. Place the dough on a floured work surface and use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a circle with a â " thickness. It's best to start rolling the dough from the center, outwards, turning the pie crust 90° on the work surface after each roll. Don't be afraid to use enough flour as needed to help prevent sticking. Use the rolling pin to help lift the dough onto the pie plate. Use your hands to press the dough into the pie plate and then follow your pie recipes directions for baking. Some pie recipes call for only a bottom crust and others call for a top and bottom crust . If your recipe calls for a top and bottom crust, you will need to double the ingredients in this recipe. How to store and freeze pie crust Store the unbaked pie crust in the fridge, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap for up to 4 days . This sourdough pie crust can be made ahead of time and kept frozen for up to 3 months . Make sure to individually wrap each disk of dough tightly in plastic wrap. To help prevent freezer-burn, insert the wrapped dough into a freezer safe bag before freezing. Tips for success The sourdough starter used in this recipe is a 100% hydration starter. That means it is made of equal parts flour and water and is reflected in the ratios of dry to wet ingredients in the pie crust recipe. This is why some people might find they need to add a little ice water when bringing the dough together. When making pie crust, it's important to use cold ingredients to make sure the butter stays in pieces within the dough. These little bits of butter scattered through out the pie crust dough will burst while baking, producing a tender, flaky crust!

All Butter Pie Crust Jump to Recipe 4.0K shares This all butter pie crust recipe is made from scratch for the most tender and flaky pie crust ever! Just follow these easy, step-by-step instructions for the perfect pie crust, every single time! There's nothing like a big slice of homemade apple pie or creamy peanut butter pie to share with your friends and family. I promise it's not hard at all to make a delicious, flaky pie crust from scratch. Just like our sourdough pie crust , it's one hundred times better than anything that you can buy pre-made at the store! This all butter pie crust is versatile too. Use it to make sweet desserts like our blueberry pie or for a savory dish such as chicken pot pie. You'll love how quick and effortless it is to make your pie crust from scratch! Ingredients All-Purpose Flour: The best flour to use for pie crust is unbleached, all-purpose flour because of it's high protein content. Pastry flour is too delicate and whole wheat flour can be too grainy. Cold Unsalted Butter: I recommend using unsalted butter whenever you are baking so that you can control the salt levels in a recipe. Ice Water/Vinegar Mixture: Adding an acid to the dough creates a more tender crust. I use white vinegar for this recipe but you can substitute it with apple cider vinegar, lemon juice or vodka . Salt and Sugar: Fine sea salt and granulated sugar work best. Instructions Prepare the water & vinegar mixture. In a one cup liquid measuring cup, place one ice cube and fill with cold water until it reaches the ½ cup mark line. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and set aside. Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl and stir. Cut the cold butter into ¼" cubes. Use a fork to gently toss and coat them in the bowl with the flour mixture. (photo 1) Cut the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter (affiliate link) until the mixture forms large, coarse crumbs. (photo 2) Drizzle the ice water into the dry ingredients and toss with a fork until the dough is evenly moist. U se your hands to bring the ingredients together in the bottom of the bowl. (photo 3) Divide the dough in half and quickly form each into a disk shape. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 1 hour before rolling out. (photo 4) Tip: Add the ice water a few tablespoons at a time . Use just enough water for the dough to come together without being crumbly. This pie crust recipe can be used for both double crust pies and single crust pies. How to cut butter into flour with a rolling pin What if you don't have a pastry cutter? No problem! You can easily use a rolling pin to get the job done! Combine Dry Ingredients and Butter in a bowl. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. Toss the cold cubed butter in the flour mixture and then dump it all onto a clean work-surface. Roll butter into flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the butter into the flour mixture. (photo a) Cut butter into smaller pieces. Use a bench scraper to cut the butter into smaller pieces. Gather the mixture back into a tight circle and repeat 3 or 4 more times. (photo b) This will create thin ribbons of butter within the flour that will help to create a super flaky crust when baked. (photo c) Place mixture back into the bowl. Use the bench scraper to scoop the mixture up and back into the mixing bowl. Proceed with step 3 from instructions above .(photo d) Tip: We've discovered an even EASIER way to incorporate butter into a pie crust. Check out how we use a cheese grater to get fine ribbons of butter in our sourdough pie crust recipe! Tips for success Cold Ingredients. Always use cold butter and ice cold water when making pie crust. After you bring the dough together you'll see little spots of butter scattered throughout the dough. That's a good thing! These little chunks are what make the dough flaky during the baking process. Rolling out the Dough. Lightly flour your work surface and the rolling pin as needed to prevent sticking. Roll the dough out to a ⅛" thickness for the perfect pie crust! Use a pie shield to protect the edge of crust from over browning. Use it during the first 25 minutes of baking. You can create a DIY pie shield from a strip of aluminum foil that is about 38" long. Fold the foil in half lengthwise, and fold it in half lengthwise again to create a 38" x 3" strip. Storage Fridge. Keep the dough tightly wrapped in plastic, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freeze. You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Wrap each dough disk with a few layers of plastic wrap to avoid freezer burn. All-Butter Pie Crust An easy, all-butter pie crust recipe that gives you a tender, flaky pie crust every time!

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes Chill Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 2 (9") pie crusts Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour 1 cup unsalted butter (cold, cut into small cubes) 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar ½ cup cold water (plus one ice cube) 2 teaspoons vinegar (or apple cider vinegar) INSTRUCTIONS Prepare the water/vinegar mixture. Drop an ice-cube into a measuring cup and fill the measuring cup up with water to the ½ cup mark. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and set aside. Mix Flour and Butter. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar together in a medium sized bowl and toss with a fork to mix evenly.

Pour the water mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into the flour/butter mixture and toss with a fork until the dough is evenly moist. Add water slowly to get the right texture. Gather the dough. Use your hands to quickly bring the dough together in the bowl. Do not over work the dough. Divide and Chill. Divide the dough in half and flatten into disks. Wrap the disks separately in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour . Bake according to what your pie recipe calls for. NOTES To Store: Dough can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. To Freeze: Wrap the dough in a few layers of plastic wrap and then put the wrapped dough into a freezer bag for up to 3 months. Form a Pie Shell: To form the pie shell, take a disk from the refrigerator and let rest for 5 minutes at room temperature. Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a 14 inch round. Wrap the dough over the rolling pin, pick it up and carefully unroll it over a 9 inch pie plate. Gently fit the pie into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to trim a 1 inch overhang. Fold the edges under and press to seal. To Freeze the pie shell: Place the pie shell into the refrigerator to chill and set for 1 hour. Wrap tightly with a few layers of plastic wrap and place in freezer until ready to bake. Store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Blind Bake: Place a piece of parchment paper or coffee filter into the center of the pie crust. Fill the center with pie weights or dry beans to keep the dough from puffing up while baking. Chill for 30 minutes. Bake the crust at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and carefully lift out the paper and weights. Prick the bottom of the crust using a fork to prevent bubbles, return to the oven for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust is golden all over.

I've used this on many types of pies, and I always get compliments from my friends and family! Thank you! Reply This says for "two pie crusts". It that two full closed pies (base and lid). Or two pastry circles, which can be either two bases or one base and lid? Reply Yes it makes two 9 inch pie crust, so you can have a top and bottom crust, or two bottom crusts. Reply I have been trying to get a apple pie recipe. Now that I have one, I'm going to the kitchen right now to make it. Will .et you know ow after I have made it. Thank you Eunice Boynton Reply I don’t know what I did wrong but the crust was maybe too thick? It was beautiful but really too hard to cut into. Help! Reply Hi Linda, usually when a pie crust has issues, it's due to the dough being over-worked and too much gluten development. Reply Excellent pie dough! My father, who only loves his mother's apple pie, LOVED it. That is like winning the pie contest of all time. And, it was so ridiculously easy. I made the dough and prepared the peeled the apples the night before. Kept the apples in ice water and lemon juice over night in the fridge. Prepared the apple mixture, assembled the pie and baked it in the morning and it was a scrumptious breakfast treat. I'm sure it will be gone before dinner. Reply Thank you for excellent instructions. I've always assumed I would mess it up by "over working the dough." Because I didn't know what that meant. You instructions explains that there SHOULD be butter clumps in the crust. So I thought, I'm just going to cut the butter as small as I can, not worry about mixing in the butter, then add just enough cold water/vinegar to get it to stick together and see what happens. My dough was totally lumpy, but I had the guts to ignore it and it was fine! I won't say it was expert level, but way way way way better than store bought and that's what I was doing before. Thank you for giving me the guts to try it! Reply This was so easy to make. I’m always intimidated by pie crusts and this one came out perfect. Used it for apple and pumpkin! Reply Just prepared the dough and it is chilling. Amazed how easy that was! When would you utilize «blind bake»?

Nutrition Calories: 476 kcal | Carbohydrates: 66 g | Protein: 6 g | Fat: 24 g Common questions How do you know when a pecan pie is set? The edges of the filling should be completely set and the center should give you a slight jiggle, like "jello", when you move the pie plate. If the middle of the pie is "wavy" when you jiggle it, it needs more time! Why is my pecan pie runny? A lot of people have this issue, including me! To remedy this problem, I add flour to the filling to thicken it. You could also try using cornstarch in place of flour. Can pecan pie be made ahead of time? Yes, this is a great pie recipe to make ahead of time. Let the pie cool completely, cover loosely, and store in the fridge until ready to serve. Is light or dark Karo syrup better for pecan pie? Either light or dark Karo syrup can be used for making pecan pie. Dark corn syrup will give the filling a darker golden color and a slightly richer flavor. 5 from 17 votes ( 14 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe?

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

When placing the apple mixture into the pie crust, make sure to spoon the apples out of the bowl and discard any excess liquid that is in the bottom of the bowl. The extra liquid can cause the crust to become soggy. The apples will continue to release moisture as the pie bakes. Should I cook apples before making pie? There is no need to cook apples before making the pie. The apples will cook during the baking process. How do I freeze a baked apple pie? Let the baked pie cool completely and then place in the freezer, uncovered. When completely frozen, tightly wrap the pie in a few layers of plastic wrap. You can also use a large freezer bag. A baked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 4 months. When you are ready to serve, let the pie thaw at room temperature for one hour. Reheat the pie in the oven at 375°F on the lowest oven rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. How do I freeze an unbaked apple pie? An unbaked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months. Follow steps 1-7 of the recipe, except DO NOT cut vents in the top of the pie crust. Place the unbaked pie in the freezer, uncovered. After one hour, remove from the freezer, tightly wrap with plastic wrap or use a plastic freezer bag. Freezing the unbaked pie before wrapping will help keep the shape of the dough around the edges. When you're ready to bake, do not thaw. Cut vents in the top of the crust and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F and bake an additional 35-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the juice begins to bubble. What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush.

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust. Best apples for pie There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store! Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process. Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety. Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others. Jonagold - A little tart and sweet. Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet. The perfect pie crust A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust . Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat! The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie. If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily. How to make apple pie from scratch Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F. Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl . Spread the apple slices evenly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in. Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long ) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise . Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield". A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking. Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan. TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish. How to store The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Print Pin Recipe Prep Time: 1 hour hour Cook Time: 1 hour hour Servings: 8 Author: Amy Duska INGREDIENTS 2 (9") pie crusts 7 large Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored and sliced into ½ inch slices) ½ cup granulated sugar ½ cup light brown sugar (loosely packed) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice (plus the zest of half of a lemon) 1 large egg (lightly beaten in a small bowl for egg wash) 2 tablespoons sanding sugar (optional) INSTRUCTIONS Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package directions. Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly. Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie plate. Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the pie shield, turn the oven down to 375° and continue to bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbly. Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

When placing the apple mixture into the pie crust, make sure to spoon the apples out of the bowl and discard any excess liquid that is in the bottom of the bowl. The extra liquid can cause the crust to become soggy. The apples will continue to release moisture as the pie bakes. Should I cook apples before making pie? There is no need to cook apples before making the pie. The apples will cook during the baking process. How do I freeze a baked apple pie? Let the baked pie cool completely and then place in the freezer, uncovered. When completely frozen, tightly wrap the pie in a few layers of plastic wrap. You can also use a large freezer bag. A baked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 4 months. When you are ready to serve, let the pie thaw at room temperature for one hour. Reheat the pie in the oven at 375°F on the lowest oven rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. How do I freeze an unbaked apple pie? An unbaked apple pie will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months. Follow steps 1-7 of the recipe, except DO NOT cut vents in the top of the pie crust. Place the unbaked pie in the freezer, uncovered. After one hour, remove from the freezer, tightly wrap with plastic wrap or use a plastic freezer bag. Freezing the unbaked pie before wrapping will help keep the shape of the dough around the edges. When you're ready to bake, do not thaw. Cut vents in the top of the crust and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F and bake an additional 35-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the juice begins to bubble. What is the best way to cut apples for pie? When making the apple pie filling, cut the apples into ½" thick slices. Thick apple slices create a sturdy pie that keeps the crust from caving into the middle. What kind of apples should you use for an apple pie? Granny Smith apples are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush. Other great varieties are: Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Jazz, Golden Delicious, Jonagold or Pink Lady. 4.99 from 805 votes ( 578 ratings without comment ) did you make this recipe?
